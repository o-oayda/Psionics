  Short Description: Adapt your body to dangerous environments
  Name: Adapt Body
  Range: Self
  Manifesting Time: 1 action
  Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
  Long Description: Your body automatically adapts to hostile environments.
    You can adapt to underwater, extremely hot, extremely cold,
    or airless environments, allowing you to survive
    as if you were a creature native to that environment.
    You can breathe and move (though penalties to movement and attacks,
    if any for a particular environment, remain),
    and you take no damage simply from being in that environment.
    You need not specify what environment you are adapting to
    when you manifest this power;
    simply activate it,
    and your body will instantly adapt to any hostile environment
    as needed throughout the duration.

    You can somewhat adapt to extreme environmental features such as acid,
    lava, fire, and lightning.
    Any environmental feature that normally directly deals
    1 or more dice of damage per round
    deals you only half the usual amount of damage.

    In any case,
    you have advantage on Constitution saving throws to maintain
    concentration on powers if damage or an otherwise
    hazardous effect from the environment you are adapting to
    prompted the save.

  Short Description: Incept an item of attraction in a creature
  Name: Attraction
  Range: 30 feet
  Manifesting Time: 1 action
  Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
  Long Description: Your Voice plants a compelling attraction
    in the mind of a creature
    that you can see and you.
    The attraction can be toward a particular person or an object.

    The target makes a Wisdom saving throw.
    If the target fails, they will take reasonable steps to meet,
    get close to, attend, or find the object of its implanted attraction.
    Otherwise, the power has no effect.

    For the purpose of this power, `reasonable' means that, while attracted,
    the target doesn't suffer from blind obsession.
    They will act on this attraction only when not engaged in combat.
    The target won't perform obviously suicidal actions.
    They can still recognize danger but will not flee
    unless the threat is immediate.

    If you make the target feel an attraction to yourself,
    you can't command them indiscriminately,
    although they will be willing to listen to you (even if they disagree).
    Accordingly, this power grants you advantage on any social skill checks
    you make involving the target.
  Augment: For every 2 additional psi dice you spend,
    this power's save DC increases by 1
    and the bonus on social skill checks increases by 1.
