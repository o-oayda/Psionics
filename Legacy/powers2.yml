  Manifesting Time: 1 action
  Range: Self
  Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
  Short Description: Adapt your body to dangerous environments
  Long Description: 'Your body automatically adapts to hostile
    environments. You can adapt to underwater, extremely hot,
    extremely cold, or airless environments, allowing you to survive
    as if you were a creature native to that environment. You
    can breathe and move (though penalties to movement and attacks,
    if any for a particular environment, remain), and you take
    no damage simply from being in that environment. You need
    not specify what environment you are adapting to when you
    manifest this power; simply activate it, and your body will
    instantly adapt to any hostile environment as needed throughout
    the duration.

    You can somewhat adapt to extreme environmental features such
    as acid, lava, fire, and lightning. Any environmental feature
    that normally directly deals 1 or more dice of damage per
    round deals you only half the usual amount of damage.

    In any case, you have advantage on Constitution saving throws
    to maintain concentration on powers if damage or an otherwise
    hazardous effect from the environment you are adapting to
    prompted the save.

  Short Description: Incept an item of attraction in a creature
  Long Description: 'Your Voice plants a compelling attraction
    in the mind of a creature that you can see and you. The attraction
    can be toward a particular person or an object.

    The target makes a Wisdom saving throw. If the target fails,
    they will take reasonable steps to meet, get close to, attend,
    or find the object of its implanted attraction. Otherwise,
    the power has no effect.

    For the purpose of this power, `reasonable'' means that, while
    attracted, the target doesn''t suffer from blind obsession.
    They will act on this attraction only when not engaged in
    combat. The target won''t perform obviously suicidal actions.
    They can still recognize danger but will not flee unless the
    threat is immediate.

    If you make the target feel an attraction to yourself, you
    can''t command them indiscriminately, although they will be
    willing to listen to you (even if they disagree). Accordingly,
    this power grants you advantage on any social skill checks
    you make involving the target. '

    First, you are invisible and inaudible to the creature. It
    cannot even detect your presence by means of blindsight, scent,
    or tremorsense. It cannot pinpoint your location by any means.
    \textit{Exception:} Creatures with truesight are still able
    to discern your location, and therefore the power has no effect
    on them.

    Second, the target remains unaware of your actions, provided
    you do not make any attacks or cause any obvious or directly
    threatening changes in the target''s environment.\ If you
    attack the target creature, the power ends.

    If you take an action that creates a sustained and obvious
    change in the target''s environment---for example, attacking
    a creature aside from the target or moving a large or attended
    object the target can see---the target immediately repeats

    creature that is able to see or perceive you can warn the

    sounds can be created. The noise produced can be virtually
    any type of sound within the volume limit. A horde of rats
    running and squeaking is about the same volume as eight humans
    running and shouting. A roaring lion is equal to the noise
    from sixteen humans, while a roaring dire lion is equal to
    the noise from twenty humans.

    you and moves as you move. You know the location of every
    psionic or magical sensor within the power''s area.

    If the viewing attempt originates within the area, you also
    know the viewer''s location. Otherwise, you and the remote
    viewer immediately make opposed checks. You make an ability
    check using your psionics ability modifier, and the remove
    viewer makes a check using their modifier for manifesting
    powers or casting spells if a power or spell respectively
    gave rise to the remote viewing. If you at least match the
    remote viewer''s result, you get a visual image of the remote
    viewer and a roughly accurate sense of the remote viewer''s
    direction and distance from you.

  Long Description: 'Your bodily assimilates some of the effects

    When you manifest this power, the total amount of cold, fire,
    lightning or thunder damage that you take from separate sources
    is reduced by 10, to a minimum of 0. The amount of damage
    that has been reduced is `absorbed''. You also have advantage
    on saving throws to maintain concentration on powers if the
    saving throw was prompted by damage of the aforementioned
    types. \emph{Note:} if a separate source of damage is reduced
    to zero, you do not need to make a Constitution saving throw
    to maintain concentration on any powers.

    Whenever you absorb damage, you store up the energy and can
    later discharge it as a jet of plasma. To discharge a ray
    requires a standard action. The ray emerges from you as a
    30-foot line with a width of 5 feet. Each creature caught
    in the path of the ray takes damage equal to the amount of
    energy damage you have stored on a failed save, or half as
    much on a successful save. However, the total damage is capped
    at five times your psionic threshold level. The ray you fire
    does fire or lightning damage (you may decide on the type).

    You can choose to fire any number of rays during the power''s
    duration. As long as this power remains in effect, you can
    continue to absorb energy damage and fire additional rays
    using the stored damage.

    range weighing no more than 250 pounds. Each turn you spend
    concentrating on this power, including the turn in which you
    manifest this power, you may move the object up to 20 feet.
    This power ends if the object is moved out of range or you
    can no longer see the object, and if you cease concentration,
    the object falls or stops.

    You may drop the object and pick up another during the same
    turn as long as you don''t stop concentrating on the power.
    You may also exert fine control on the objects you move. The
    object does not move fast enough to cause any damage when
    being rammed into other creatures or objects, however it can
    cause damage to creatures and objects if it is dropped onto
    them. In this case, the object or creature deals as much bludgeoning
    damage as it would take from the fall itself. If the object
    falls onto a creature, they must make a Dexterity saving throw,
    taking the full damage on a failed save and no damage on a
    successful save.

    If the object you are attempting to move is being being carried,
    worn or is equipped to a creature in some way, the creature
    can prevent you from moving the object. If they do so, make
    an ability check with your psionics ability modifier (not
    psionics attack modifier) contested by their Strength check.
    If they win the contest, you cannot move that and any other
    object until your turn ends. If the contest ends in a draw,
    you cannot move that object, but you may attempt to move others. '

    has a side length of 10 feet per psionic threshold. You can

    a radius of up to 1 foot per psionic threshold. The wall must
    be continuous and unbroken when manifested. If its surface
    is interrupted by any object or creature, the power fails.

    Each 10-foot panel of the wall (or section of surface area
    100 ft.$^2$) has 10 hit points per inch of thickness and damage
    immunity (5). A section of the wall whose hit points drop

    number of inches it is thick.

    The wall is susceptible to the \power{dispel psionics} power,

    the wall is negated in such a way. Spells and breath weapons
    cannot pass through the wall in either direction, since the

    creatures or objects on the opposite side of the wall. However,
    the wall does not block travel by Spacefolding. The wall is

  Short Description: Skate along ground and move faster
  Long Description: 'You, another willing creature, or an unattended
    object can slide along solid ground as if on smooth ice. If
    you manifest skate on yourself or another creature, the target
    of the power retains equilibrium by mental desire alone, allowing
    them to gracefully skate along the ground, turn, or stop suddenly
    as desired. The skater''s base movement speed increases by
    15 feet. As with any effect that increases speed, this power
    affects the target''s maximum jumping distance.

    The target can skate up or down any incline or decline they
    could normally walk upon without mishap, though skating up
    an incline reduces the target''s speed to normal, while skating
    down a decline increases their speed by an additional 15 feet.

    If you manifest skate on an object, treat the object as having
    only one-tenth of its normal weight for the purpose of dragging
    it along the ground.

  Short Description: Fuse yourself and another creature into one

  Long Description: 'You and another willing, corporeal, living
    creature of the same or smaller size fuse into one being.
    As the manifester, you control the actions of the fused being.
    However, you can give up this control to the other creature.
    Once you give up control, you cannot regain it unless the
    other creature relinquishes it.

    The fused being has your current hit points plus the other
    creature''s current hit points. The fused being knows all
    the powers you and the other creature know, has the sum of
    your and the other creature''s psi dice, has the sum of your
    and the other creature''s spell slots, and knows or has prepared
    any spells you or the other creature possesses (if any). Likewise,
    all feats, racial abilities, and class features are pooled
    (if both creatures have the same ability, the fused being
    gains it only once). For each of the six ability scores, the
    fused being''s score is the higher of yours and the other
    creature''s, and the fused being also has the higher hit dice
    and psionic threshold; this effectively means the fused being
    uses the better saving throws, attack bonus, and skill modifiers
    of either member, and it manifests powers up to the higher
    of the psionic thresholds that you or the other creature possessed
    before becoming fused.

    You decide what equipment is absorbed into the fused being
    and what equipment remains available for use. These fused
    items are restored once the power ends.

    When the power ends, the fused being separates. The other
    creature appears in an area adjacent to you that you determine.
    If separation occurs in a cramped space, the other creature
    is expelled through the Astral Plane, finally coming to rest
    materially in the nearest empty space and taking 1d6 force
    damage for each 10 feet of solid material passed through.

    Damage taken by the fused being is split evenly between you
    and the other creature when the power ends. You do not leave
    the fusion with more hit points than you entered it with,
    unless you were damaged prior to the fusion and the fused
    being was subsequently healed. In a like manner, the fused
    being''s remaining power points are split between you and
    the other creature (you can leave with more points than you
    entered with, as long as you don''t exceed the maximum power
    points for your level and ability score).

    If a fused being is killed, it separates into its constituent
    creatures, both of which are also dead.

    You can force the target to stand up, sit down, walk, turn
    around, and so on, but operating the vocal cords is too difficult.
    You can also hold the target immobile, rendering it incapacitated.
    You cannot force the target to manifest powers, cast spells,
    or use any special ability that is not a function of just
    its body movements. If you lose sight of the target, the effect
    of this power ends.

    If you force the target to engage in combat, its attack bonus
    is equal to your psionics attack bonus, and its bonus on damage
    rolls is equal to your Intelligence bonus. A creature subject
    to this power cannot take reactions. The target gains no benefit
    to its AC from its Dexterity, but it does gain a bonus to

    hand.

    If you want to aim the vortex at a specific creature you can
    see in range, you can make a psionics attack to strike the
    creature. If you succeed, direct contact with the vortex deals
    8d6 bludgeoning damage to the creature. Otherwise, you may
    pick any point you can see in range.

    Regardless of whether your psionics attack hits (and even
    if you forgo the attack), all creatures (including the one
    possibly damaged by direct contact) within a cylinder of radius
    40 feet and height 100 feet are picked up and violently dashed

  Short Description: ' See distant locations known or proximate
    to you'
  Long Description: 'You can see and hear a distant location almost
    as if you were there. You don''t need to see the location,
    but the locale must be known; that is, it must be a place
    familiar to you or an obvious one proximate to you, such as
    behind a nearby door, around a nearby corner, or in a grove
    of local trees. Once you have selected the locale, the focus
    of your clairvoyant sense doesn''t move, but you can rotate
    it in all directions to view the area as desired. Unlike other
    scrying powers, this power does not allow psionically or supernaturally
    enhanced senses to work through it.

    If the chosen locale is magically or psionically dark, you
    see nothing. If it is naturally pitch black, you can see in
    a 10-foot radius around the center of the power''s effect
    or out to the extent of your natural darkvision. The power
    does not work across planes.

  Long Description: "You can learn details of an inanimate object's\

    \ the last owner of the item, and the original owner (if you\
    \ keep the power active long enough).\nThere is a 90\\% chance\
    \ that this power will successfully identify all other former\
    \ owners in sequence, but there is a 10\\% chance that one\
    \ former owner will be skipped and thus not identified.\n\
    This power will not identify casual users as owners (anyone\
    \ who uses an object to attack someone or something is not\
    \ thereafter considered a casual user).\nAn object without\
    \ any previous owners reveals no information. You can continue\
    \ to run through a list of previous owners and learn details\
    \ about them as long as the power's duration lasts. If you\
    \ use this power additional times on the same object, the\
    \ information yielded is the same as if you were using the\
    \ power on the object for the first time. "

  Short Description: ' Glean information from the psychic impressions
    left in a locale'
  Long Description: 'You gain historical vision in a given location.
    Rooms, streets, tunnels, and other discrete locations accumulate
    psychic impressions left by powerful emotions experienced
    in a given area. These impressions offer you a picture of
    the location''s past.

    The types of events most likely to leave psychic impressions
    are those that elicited strong emotions: battles and betrayals,
    marriages and murders, births and great pain, or any other
    event where one emotion dominates. Everyday occurrences leave
    no residue for a manifester to detect.

    The vision of the event is dreamlike and shadowy. You do not
    gain special knowledge of those involved in the vision, though
    you might be able to read large banners or other writing if
    they are in your language.

    Beginning with the most recent significant event at a location
    and working backward in time, you can sense one distinct event
    for every 10 minutes you maintain concentration, if any such
    events exist to be sensed. Your sensitivity extends into the
    past a maximum number of years equal to 200 times your psionic
    threshold.

    if it is an event, they will not willingly attend it. The
    subject will take reasonable steps to avoid the object of
    its aversion, but will not put themselves in jeopardy by doing
    so.

  Manifesting Time: 1 action

  Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
  Short Description: ' Disrupt a creature''s breathing'
  Long Description: 'Your Voice compels a humanoid creature you
    can see in range to purge its entire store of air in one explosive
    exhalation, and thereby disrupt the target''s autonomic breathing
    cycle. The target''s lungs do not automatically function again
    while the powers''s duration lasts.

    If the target succeeds on a Wisdom save when crisis of breath
    is manifested, it is unaffected by this power. If it fails
    its Wisdom save, it can still continue to breathe by taking
    a standard action in each round to gasp for breath.

    An affected creature can attempt to take actions normally
    (instead of consciously controlling its breathing), but each
    round it does so, beginning in the round when it failed its
    Wisdom save, the target risks blacking out from lack of oxygen.
    It must succeed on a Constitution save at the end of any of
    its turns in which it did not consciously take a breath. The
    DC of this save increases by 1 in every consecutive round
    after the first one that goes by without a breath; the DC
    drops back to its original value if the target spends an action
    to take a breath.

    If a target fails its Constitution save, it becomes unconscious.
    At the end of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points but
    must take death saving throws. Curing powers or spells can
    revive a dying subject normally, so long as this power''s
    duration has expired; f the power is still in effect, a revived
    creature is still subject to Constitution saves in each round
    when it does not consciously breathe. '
  Augment: You can augment this power in one or more of the following
    ways.\begin{itemize  \item If you spend 6 additional power
    points,        this power can affect up to four creatures        all
    within a 20-foot radius.  \item If you spend 4 additional
    power points,        this power can also affect creatures
    other than a humanoid,        assuming they have a aerobic
    respiratory system to disrupt.\end{itemize

  Long Description: 'Your Voice compels a creature to act according
    to your wishes. Choose a creature within range that can hear
    and understand you. You then suggest a course of activity
    limited to no more than five words that that creature is to
    take. The course of action can be harmful to the creature
    or contrary to its intentions.

    The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. The target has
    advantage on the saving throw if the course of action is plainly
    harmful or against the creature''s wishes. If the target fails,
    it pursues the course of action to the best of its ability.
    The compelled course of action can continue for the entire
    duration of the power. If the compelled activity can be completed
    in a shorter time, the power ends when the target finishes
    what it was asked to do.

    You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special
    activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest
    that a knight give her warhorse to the first beggar she meets.
    If the condition isn''t met before the power expires, the
    activity isn''t performed.
