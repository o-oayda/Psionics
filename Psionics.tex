  {Frank Herbert\\\textit{Dune} (1965)}

\DndDropCapLine{T}{he Old Way is the ancient doctrine}
of the mind.
It holds that each individual has a latent psionic talent,
which, for many,
is never awakened.
But those who do awaken that which lies dormant
are granted new, incredible and potentially terrifying
vistas of awareness---and the promise of great power.

This supplement expounds the rules around psionics:
a broad term referring to the powerful effects
manifested by the mind.
In \secref{chap:using_psionics},
the basic mechanics are explained,
and in \secref{chap:list_of_powers},
an exhaustive list of all available powers is set out.
Psionics are accessible by two new classes: the psion
and the psi knight.
These are presented in \secref{chap:classes}.
Lastly, miscellaneous additions and rules addenda
are given in \secref{chap:miscellany},
including new feats and changes to existing races.\newpage

This psionics system is based heavily on the
\emph{Expanded Psionics Handbook} of 3.5e.
Many powers have been taken from that work
and translated into the language of 5e.
That being said, many features and powers are new.
Some of these powers are based on works of fiction
the reader may be familiar with...
In any case,
if a player engages with the new psionics framework,
they should come in with the assumption that the rules
and balance are to change rapidly and regularly;
this system has not been play-tested.

\subsection*{Using this Supplement}
This supplement does not overwrite or supersede any
of the established rules in the base game,
except where otherwise noted.
To aid in clarity,
this supplement uses boldface for \define{game terms}
at their first instance in the text.
Game terms are specific phrases of words which
carry an immutable packet of meaning.
Unlike natural language,
which has contextual dependence,
game terms mean the same thing everywhere.
This is done to avoid ambiguity as best as possible.

Questions of interpretation surrounding psionics
must be resolved by the DM,
given that this is a new, stand-alone system.
Questions of interpretation surrounding the interaction
between the base game and psionics are similarly resolved.
Although it was stated that this supplement does not
overwrite the base game,
some degree of conflict is inevitable.
Priority is given to what is written in this supplement
as opposed to what is written in the base game
where this occurs.
Questions of interpretation related to the base game
are resolved as normal.

\chapter{Using Psionics}
\label{chap:using_psionics}
\DndDropCapLine{T}{his chapter explains the nature of}
psionics, as well as the key rules behind
producing and maintaining psionic powers.
In \secref{sec:what_are_psionics},
a brief introduction to psionics is given
and their role in their game.
\secref{sec:manifesting_powers} explains how
psionic abilities---called powers---are produced
and the restrictions surrounding their use.
Lastly,
in \secref{sec:power_attributes},
the terminology used in power descriptions is explained.
The reader should familiarise themselves with each of these in turn
before diving into
the list of powers in \secref{chap:list_of_powers}.

\section{What are Psionics?}
\label{sec:what_are_psionics}
Psionics tap into the latent ability of the mind
to master itself, its body and its environment.
Whereas spellcasters manipulate the magical essence
innate to the cosmological order,
users of psionics rely on their mind's power alone.
For many creatures,
using any psionic power,
let alone mastering a psionic discipline,
takes years, even decades of rigorous mental training.
That being said,
some creatures have a natural propensity for psionics,
for example the children of Gith, illithids and aboleths.

Many refer to psionics as \emph{the Old Way}.
This is because there is a school of thought that
the seeds of all creatures---the progenitor beings
which gave rise to existence itself---were
masters of the mind.
According to this doctrine,
magic and spellcraft were created by these
beings when the reality was moulded to as it is today.
To do this, they used psionics.

\subsection{Types of Psionic Abilities}
There are three types of psionic abilities:
\define{powers}, \define{innate talents} and \define{psi-like abilities}.

\subsubsection{Powers}
Powers are what most psionics users will be
interacting with.
The rules around powers are described
later in this chapter.

\subsubsection{Innate Talents}
A second type of psionic ability is an innate talent.
Innate talents are generally possessed by NPCs or
monsters which have some psionic ability.
They are also accessible if a character's race
has some degree of psionic heritage.
Innate talents are produced on a per day basis;
that is, a creature can use a certain innate talent
a number of times per day.
These are written as `\textit{x}/day innate talent'.
Innate talents can be used as a convenience,
representing an NPCs psionic ability but
foregoing the need to keep track of mental bandwidth,
psionic thresholds and psi dice.

To clarify,
an innate talent is linked to a particular power
in \secref{chap:list_of_powers}.
For example,
a creature might have
`\nameref{pwr:leap} (3/day innate talent)'.
The rules surrounding manifesting powers
as innate talents are the same as if
the power was manifested otherwise, except:
\begin{itemize}
    \item There is no mental bandwidth requirement;
    \item There is no psi dice cost;
    \item There is no psionic threshold requirement; and,
    \item An innate talent cannot be augmented unless
        otherwise specified.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Psi-like Abilities}
Lastly, a psi-like ability is a psionic effect produced by an NPC or monster,
and is generally not accessible to player characters.
For example, a psi-like ability may be available as a specific
action in a creature's stat block.
Psi-like abilities are typically derived from a specific power,
but have minor alterations, as reflected in the stat block.

Like innate talents,
psi-like abilities have no mental bandwidth and psionic threshold requirement,
nor psi dice cost.
Like all types of psionic abilities,
psi-like abilities count as psionics for the purposes of, for example,
psionic resistance or vulnerability.

\begin{DndSidebar}[float=htbp]{Interaction with Magic}
    \tocside{Interaction with Magic}Since
    psionics and magic are disparate entities,
    how do they interact together?
    A creature that uses a psionic power is not
    casting a spell,
    and therefore any ability which negates the effects
    of magic cannot negate the power.
    For example, psionic powers cannot be affected by
    \spell{counterspell} or \spell{dispel magic}.

    However, certain psionic powers are explicitly stated
    to interact with magic.
    In addition, this supplement adds spells to the existing
    grimoire which explicitly interact with psionics.
\end{DndSidebar}

\section{Manifesting Powers}
\label{sec:manifesting_powers}
When a creature wills the effects of a psionic power
into existence,
they are said to be \define{manifesting} that power.
In this context,
they are referred to as the \define{manifester}.
In order to manifest a psionic power,
the \define{power level} must be equal to or below
the manifesting character's \define{psionic threshold}.
The psionic threshold is determined by the character's class.
If the power satisfies this test,
it can be manifested if they are able to
meet the power's \define{psi dice (PD)} cost.
The manifesting character will also need to take note of their
\define{mental bandwidth (MB)} and consider whether or not manifesting
the power will exceed this bandwidth.
Each of these concepts are explained below.

\subsection{Psionic Threshold}
The psionic threshold represents the strongest powers
that a psionics user can learn and manifest.
Powers have levels from 1 to 9 in the same way that spells do;
the higher the level, the more powerful the effects.
The psionic threshold is determined by a character's class
and level,
as shown in the class tables of \secref{chap:classes}.
When levelling,
a character can only learn powers with a level up to
their psionic threshold.
This is explained in more detail in the same chapter.

Each power has a level written in its description.
If a character attempts to manifest a power with level
greater than their psionic threshold,
the power fails to manifest,
however no cost is incurred in doing so,
see \secref{sub:psi_dice}.

\subsection{Mental Bandwidth}
Manifesting powers strains the mind and the body.
Mental bandwidth represents the amount of psionic strain that
a character can endure while using psionics,
and is determined by the character's psionic class and level,
see \secref{chap:classes}.
Mental bandwidth is divided into slots,
and all powers take up a different number of slots.

When a character manifests a power,
they note their total mental bandwidth
as determined by their class and level.
This is called the
\define{maximum mental bandwidth}.
They then subtract from the maximum mental bandwidth
any slots which are taken up by powers they are already concentrating on,
see \secref{sub:concentration}.
The number determined after this subtraction is called the
\define{effective mental bandwidth}.
If the power to be manifested has a mental bandwidth
greater than the effective mental bandwidth,
the character must make a Constitution saving throw with
DC equal to 10 plus twice the number of slots
in excess of their effective bandwidth.
Note that it does not matter if the power to be manifested
does not require concentration---the power's mental bandwidth cost
still needs to be considered.

For example,
suppose Kadoth is a 10th level psion
and therefore has a maximum mental bandwidth of 6.
They are already concentrating on \nameref{pwr:adapt_body},
which takes up 4 mental bandwidth slots,
so their effective mental bandwidth is 2.
They then attempt to manifest the \nameref{pwr:time_warp} power,
which takes up 3 slots.
Since this puts them in excess of their effective bandwidth by 1,
they make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw ($10 + 2 \times 1)$.

\subsubsection{Becoming Strained}
If a character fails this Constitution saving throw,
the power fails to manifest
and the psi dice cost is still incurred.
In addition, the manifester gains the \textbf{strained} condition.

The severity and nature of the strained condition
depends on the number of slots
that were in excess of the effective bandwidth when the attempt
to manifest the power was made.
Each slot that was in excess counts as one level of strain.
The manifester then assigns each level of accrued strain
to \define{mind strain} or \define{body strain},
which are shown in the tables below.
They may freely choose between either type of strain
for each level accrued.
The effects are cumulative,
such that a manifester with a body strain level of 3
incurs the effect from the 1st, 2nd and 3rd rows of the
body strain table.
Body strain and mind strain are also simultaneous;
if a manifester has any levels of mind strain and body strain,
they incur the associated penalties of each.
Lastly,
if a manifester already has any level of mind or body strain
after failing the Constitution saving throw,
the newly-acquired levels of strain are added to the current levels.

In Kadoth's example,
they were only in excess by 1.
They therefore assign themselves one level of strain,
and may choose either mind strain or body strain.
If they choose body strain and already have 1 level of body strain,
they would reach level 2 of body strain.

In the tables below,
\textbf{physical} checks and saving throws refer to those
that use Strength, Dexterity or Constitution as the
underlying modifier,
whereas \textbf{mental} checks and saving throws refer to those
that use Intelligence, Wisdom or Charisma as the underlying modifier. 

\begin{table}[htbp]%
    \begin{DndTable}[width=\columnwidth,
                     header=Body Strain]{
                     c X}
        Level & Effect \\
        1  & AC bonus from Dexterity reduced to 0 \\
        2  & Speed halved \\
        3  & Disadvantage on physical checks and saving throws \\
        4  & Hit point maximum halved \\
        5 & Death
    \end{DndTable}
\end{table}

\begin{table}[htbp]%
    \begin{DndTable}[width=\columnwidth,
                     header=Mind Strain]{
                     c X}
        Level & Effect \\
        1  & Can no longer take reactions \\
        2  & Can no longer take bonus actions \\
        3  & Disadvantage on mental checks and saving throws \\
        4  & MB halved (round down) \\
        5  & Death
    \end{DndTable}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Recovering from Strain}
A character loses the strained condition,
including all of the accumulated levels of mind or body strain,
when they finish a long rest.

In addition, during a short rest,
a character may spend hit dice to remove
cumulative levels of mind or body strain on a 1 to 1 basis.
For example,
if a character was three slots in excess of their
effective mental bandwidth when they attempted
to manifest a power,
and as a result they have decided to
accrue three levels of solely body strain,
they can spend one hit die to remove the third level,
another to remove the second level,
and a final one to remove the first level.
If the manifester no longer has any levels of mind or body strain
after this process, the strained condition is removed altogether. 
A character cannot remove one level of strain
and roll to gain hit points with the same hit die.

\subsection{Psi Dice}
\label{sub:psi_dice}
When manifesting a power,
a character must expend a number of psi dice
equal to the number stated in the power's description.
The number of psi dice a character has is determined
by their class and level, see \secref{chap:classes}.
% A character also gains additional psi dice per level
% based on their psionics ability modifier (see below).
If a character has less psi dice than the total psi dice cost
of the power, the power fails (but no dice are expended).

The total base psi dice cost of a power is determined by its level.
The cost is equal to one less than double the power's level.
This is shown in the table below.
For example, a 1st level power incurs a cost of {\lvlone} psi die,
whereas a 5-th level power incurs a cost of {\lvlfive} psi dice.
\begin{table*}[htbp]%
    \begin{DndTable}[width=\textwidth,
                     header=Psi Dice Cost by Level]{
                     X X X X X X X X X X}
         Level         & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6  & 7  & 8  & 9 \\
        \textbf{Cost}  & \lvlone & \lvltwo & \lvlthree & \lvlfour & \lvlfive
                       & \lvlsix & \lvlseven & \lvleight & \lvlnine
    \end{DndTable}
\end{table*}

Some powers can be \define{augmented} with extra psi dice, in which
case they usually have a stronger effect, see \secref{sub:augmenting}.
If a power can be augmented,
this will be explicitly stated in its description.
The cost for augmenting a power is also given in its description.

\subsection{Concentration}
\label{sub:concentration}
If stipulated in the power description,
a power requires uninterrupted concentration
in order to be continually used.
There is no limit to the number of powers that may be
simultaneously concentrated on,
however each power concentrated on will take away from the
available mental bandwidth slots, as mentioned above.

Whenever a manifester takes damage while
concentrating on any number of powers,
they must make a Constitution saving throw.
The DC of the save is either equal to 10 or half the damage taken,
whichever is higher.
Each separate source of damage prompts a separate save.
If the save fails,
the manifester loses concentration on all the powers they were
concentrating on.
In addition, the DM may call the manifester to make a
save with any DC in a circumstance that would
jeopardise the manifester's concentration,
like being thrown off a flying broom or
being battered by an intense blizzard.

A manifester may at any time on their turn
stop concentrating on any power.
However, a manifester will automatically stop concentrating on a power
if they become incapacitated or if they die.

\begin{DndSidebar}[float=htbp]{Concentrating on Powers/Spells}
    \tocside{Concentrating on Powers/Spells}If a character
    can both cast spells and manifest powers,
    they may not simultaneously concentrate on a spell
    and any number of powers.
    Additionally, some spells, such as \spell{sleet storm},
    can specifically disrupt a spellcaster's concentration.
    A spell or effect which calls for a Constitution saving throw
    if a creature is concentrating on a spell
    also applies if a creature is concentrating on a power.
    The save DC is identical in either case,
    and the effects for losing concentration on powers
    are described above.
\end{DndSidebar}

\section{Power Attributes}
\label{sec:power_attributes}
In \secref{chap:list_of_powers},
the available powers are given.
In this section,
the terminology and structure of the power descriptions are explained.

\subsection{Level and Discipline}
Beneath the name of the power,
the power level and discipline are given.
Each power is associated with a discipline,
of which there are six.
These are described below.

\subsubsection{Prescience}
Strictly, the discipline of prescience relates to psionic powers
which allow the manifester to peer through time and see future events.
Prescient manifesters describe the future as
an undulating cloth blowing in a swift breeze,
with the hills and valleys of its surface representing
future possibilities. 

However,
the discipline of prescience incorporates additional tenets,
and its adherents are also characterised by an uncanny ability to
understand the past and know things not normally known to
the untrained mind.

\subsubsection{Prana Bindu}
The discipline of Prana Bindu stresses that the mind and body
must work in close concert with each other.
Adherents have a profound mastery of nerve and muscle,
and can react to situations with speeds nearly imperceptible
to the untrained eye.
The discipline also allows one to alter their internal equilibrium
and metabolism at will,
granting the body the ability to heal and adapt to hostile environments.

The discipline of Prana Bindu is especially favoured by psi knights,
powerful warriors who fuse martial and mental prowess.
See \secref{sec:psi_knight} for details on the psi knight class.

\subsubsection{Voice}
The Voice is a dangerous but supremely powerful tool
used to dominate the minds and wills of others.
Adherents hone their speech in such a way that,
only by subtle changes in pitch, volume and speed,
their Voice can control the behaviour of others,
compelling them to act against their own will.

In addition, adherents to the discipline can manifest their Voice
in the minds of others, allowing them to telepathically
communicate with other creatures.

\subsubsection{Metacreativity}
The discipline of metacreativity allows the manifester to mould
matter as they desire,
turning the mundane into useful tools or deadly weapons.
A metacreator can also in this manner craft constructs
which bend to their mind,
allowing myriad servants to carry out their bidding.

\subsubsection{Spacefolding}
A spacefolder warps the fabric of space and time to
transport themselves and others.
This also allows them to move effortlessly in conditions
that would otherwise impede or slow down movement. 
Many powerful spacefolders can even cross the gap between
the planes themselves.

\subsubsection{Psychokinesis}
The discipline of psychokinesis allows one to transform
their raw mental energy into destructive power,
unleashing havoc on the battlefield.
Psychokineticists can deal terrifying amounts of damage
and leave their enemies trembling in awe and fear.

\subsection{Manifesting Time}
Each power has a \define{manifesting time},
which may be a bonus action, action, or reaction.
Unlike spellcasting,
there is no level restriction to manifesting powers
on the same turn where one has been manifested
with a bonus action. 

In addition, some powers may have longer casting times,
in which case on each round the manifester must use their action
to manifest the power while maintaining concentration.
While the manifester is maintaining concentration in this way,
the power will take up the specified number
of mental bandwidth slots given in the power's description.
If their concentration is broken, the power fails,
but no psi dice are expended,
and the mental bandwidth slots are freed up.

\subsection{Range}
A power's \define{range} indicates the extent
to which its effects can reach when manifested.
The \define{target} (see below) of the power must be within range.

There are three types of ranges: self, touch and a range
specified in feet.
Powers with a range of self will always target the manifester.

Much like spells,
once a power is manifested,
its effects are't limited by range.
For example,
if a manifester is concentrating on a power,
and the target moves out of line of effect or out of
the range of the original power,
the power does not end and concentration is maintained.
\textit{Exception:} some powers explicitly state otherwise.

\subsubsection{Targets}
\label{subs:targets}
All powers have a target or targets.
A power's target is typically mentioned in the power description.
The description will also specify whether or not the target
of a power needs to be seen.
Thus, not all powers require sight of the target.

Additionally, some powers will
require the manifester to have \define{line of effect}
towards the target.
This means that the manifester needs to be be able to draw a line
to the target without that line passing through an obstacle,
even if the target can be seen through that obstacle.
Thus, a target cannot be behind total cover.
Powers which have the line of effect requirement
will explicitly state this in their descriptions.
Powers with a range of self or touch
will never require line of effect.

\subsection{Cost}
The \define{cost} specifies the mental bandwidth and psi die
that must be allocated and expended respectively to manifest the power.
For example,
`MB 1, PD 1'
means that the power takes up 1 slot of mental bandwidth
and costs one psi die to manifest.

\subsection{Duration}
The \define{duration} of a power is how long the effects
of a power remain active.
Powers can be instantaneous,
while others can last for any length of time
as specified in the powers description.

If the power requires concentration throughout its duration,
this will be indicated alongside the duration.

\subsection{Areas of Effect}
Some powers specify in their description an area of effect
over which the power manifests.
In this case, the rules governing these areas of effect
are identical to those of spellcasting, which begin at
phb 202.

\subsection{Affecting Targets}
Some powers specify that the manifester makes an attack
roll against each target,
whereas some specify that all targets need to make
a type of saving throw.

If the power specifies an attack roll,
then the manifester rolls a d20
and adds their \define{psionics attack modifier},
which is their \define{psionics ability modifier}
(determined by class)
plus their proficiency bonus.

If the power specifies a saving throw,
then each target must succeed on a saving throw
with DC equal to 8 + the manifester's psionic attack modifier.
The type of saving throw
is specified in the power's description.

\subsection{Augmenting Powers}
\label{sub:augmenting}
Some powers will indicate that they can be \define{augmented},
which is analogous to upcasting for a spellcaster.
When augmenting a power,
the manifester spends additional psi dice on top of the cost
incurred from the level of the power itself
(see \secref{sub:psi_dice} for the base cost by power level).

The cost required to augment a power will be specified
in the power's description (\define{augment cost}).
For example, the description might mention,
`For every two additional psi dice you spend\dots'
In this case, the cost to augment the power is 2 psi dice.
Each time the power is augmented,
its level increases by 1.
In the example above,
spending an additional 6 psi dice increases the power's level by 3.

A power cannot be augmented to a level beyond the manifester's
psionic threshold.
For example,
if a manifester has a psionic threshold of 3,
they may spend 4 psi dice to augment a power from
1st to 3rd level with an augment cost of 2,
but may not go beyond 3rd level i.e. spend beyond 4 psi dice.

Some powers can be augmented in a multitude of ways,
each with different effects
and potentially different augment costs.
Every time you pay the augment cost,
the power's level is increased by one
irregardless of the type of augment you choose.

\subsection{Requirements}
The power's description will indicate additional \define{requirements}
that must be satisfied before the power can be manifested,
somewhat akin to the components in a spell's description.
However, unlike spells,
many powers are not associated with a verbal component.
When a power is manifested,
quite often there are scarcely any hints of its existence,
save for the actual effect or effects it produces.

Powers which have no additional requirements will state
`\textbf{Requirements:} None' in their descriptions.
Otherwise, the requirement(s) will be listed.
These include the requirement that the manifester can
see the target (\define{Sight}),
and that the target has line of effect towards the target
(\define{Line of Effect}).
Other requirements are described below,
and all possible requirements are summarised in the
table below.
\begin{table}[htbp]%
    \begin{DndTable}[width=\columnwidth,
                     header=Power Requirements]{
                     l X}
        Requirement & Description \\
        Sight & The manifester must be able to see the target(s) \\
        Line of Effect & The manifester must have line of effect
                            towards the target(s) \\
        Mundane Matter & The manifester must be touching mundane matter \\
        Speech & The manifester must be able to speak,
                    and the target(s) must be able to hear
                    and understand the manifester
                    unless otherwise stated \\
        None & No additional requirements apply for the power
    \end{DndTable}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Voice Powers}
\label{subs:voice_powers}
Powers belonging to the Voice discipline sometimes involve
the manifester altering the frequencies, pitch and
speed of their natural voice, as well as their choice
of language, such that it compels
creatures to act in certain ways.
Whenever such a power makes reference to the manifester
using their Voice (e.g. `Your Voice does \textit{x}'),
the power is listed with the requirement \define{Speech}.
This means that
\begin{itemize}
    \item The manifester must be able to speak;
    \item The target(s) must be able to hear the manifester; and,
    \item The target(s) must be able to understand the manifester
\end{itemize}
in order for the power to have any effect.
If any of the latter two conditions are not met,
the power simply does not manifest as a valid target
cannot be specified.
If the speaking condition is not met,
the power fails but no psi dice are expended.
\textit{Exception:} some powers with the Speech requirement
will specify that any of the peripheral conditions listed above
do not apply.

The manifester's Voice is distinctly audible
up to the maximum range of the Voice power,
plus an additional 2d6 times 10 feet
(roll when the power is manifested).
Additionally, the use of the Voice is immediately obvious;
a creature that hears the Voice will be able to distinguish
it from ordinary speech,
even if they know not of the Voice or
the nature of the power which has been manifested.

If a power does not make reference to the manifester
using their Voice and thus lacks the Speech requirement,
this means that the manifester relies on their
\define{inner Voice}: the silent projection of their will
into the mind of another.
The manifester need not be able to be speak,
nor need the target(s) to hear and understand them
when manifesting this power.
The manifestation also does not produce a physical sound.

\subsubsection{Metacreativity Powers}
All powers of the Metacreativity discipline have the
\define{Mundane Matter} requirement.
Mundane matter, which is moulded by the manifester,
refers to common substances on the
Material Plane,
like soil, plant matter, rock, metal,
glass, and so on.
The matter must be in the solid phase,
and not the liquid, gas or plasma phase.
It does not include matter imbued with magic
or some other arcane effect,
unless that matter is the raw essence of Limbo,
which can be warped with one's mind.

Thus,
if the manifester is not touching mundane matter
when they manifest a Metacreativity power,
the power fails (but no cost is incurred in the attempt).

\chapter{Classes}
\label{chap:classes}
\DndDropCapLine{H}{ere, two psionics users are}
presented: the psion at \secref{sec:psion} and the psi knight at
\secref{sec:psi_knight}.
The psion is a full user of psionics,
focusing nearly exclusively on their mental prowess
to manifest devastatingly effective powers.
They have access to the largest number of powers,
and can hone their talent further by specialising
in a particular discipline.
The psi knight is a martial warrior
who supplements their fighting ability with
psionics.
This makes them a highly versatile and formidable
opponent on the battlefield.

\section{Psion}
\label{sec:psion}
\DndSetThemeColor[DmgLavender]
In the audience chamber of the Duke of Baradstone,
a half-elf pries into the pathways of Duke's mind---their
thoughts, feelings, desires revealed to her
with lucid precision.
All the while, the Duke's retinue remain totally oblivious
to the psionic intrusion.

In an vanishing instant of time,
the githzerai projects the movements of his
githyanki foes two seconds into the future,
giving himself the edge he needs to lure them
into a carefully-placed trap.

The tiefling crouches imperceptibly behind the garrison,
recalling her Prana Bindu training regimen to force
her body to make no sound.
Then, she focuses on the sword carried by the guardsman;
before he takes his next step,
the steel burns a brilliant red before exploding in his
very hand.

In the underbelly of the city,
the dwarf brushes his hand against the ancient stone.
Its feeling, its texture, ignite a subconscious
awareness within his mind,
and he is borne back to the memory of countless aeons
past.
He watches in striking detail as the genetic memory unravels,
showing his forebears laying the same stone---one piece
of a much larger city which has been lost to the entropic
assault of time.

\subsection{Masters of the Mind}
While psions are diverse in their abilities and training,
all are unified by a common thread---their unparalleled
mastery over the latent powers that lie within their mind.
While some turn to the magic essence which suffuses the cosmos,
psions peer inwards,
unlocking powers which might have laid dormant over many years.
Only through strict training and profound mental discipline
can these powers be unlocked,
which all psions have been through in one way or another.

Psions manifest distinct effects known as powers, which,
depending on their discipline, achieve myriad effects.
Powers are integral to the effectiveness of a psion,
and the more experience they accrue,
the more powers they unlock from deep within.

\subsection{Creating a Psion}
Creating a character with the psion class prompts
important questions.
How did your character first become aware of the
powers of the mind?
Perhaps they found an old, forgotten tome
describing the \emph{Old Way} and the monks who adhered
to it.
Or they might have been awoken to it abruptly,
awakening a dormant power which manifested fleetingly.

One additional line of inquiry should be about the nature
of their training.
How did your character hone their psionic abilities?
Did they train with the githzerai in their floating citadels
on Limbo?
Did they live with a reclusive order who have knowledge
of psionic powers?
Or did they train by themselves,
experimenting with their mind through trial and error?

\subsubsection{Quick Build}
You can make a psion quickly by following these suggestions.
First, Intelligence should be your highest ability score,
followed by Constitution.
Second, choose the following three 1st-level psion powers:
\nameref{pwr:blow_up_object_with_mind},
\nameref{pwr:mind_thrust}
and \nameref{pwr:precognition}.
If you have access to a 1st level power on your discipline
sublist (see \secref{subs:psion_discipline}),
choose that over one of the powers given above.

\begin{DndSidebar}[float=htbp]{Multiclassing with the Psion}
    \tocside{Multiclassing with the Psion}In order to
    multiclass into the psion class,
    a character must have a minimum Intelligence score of 13
    (in addition to the usual score requirement for their base class).
    When you multiclass into the psion class,
    you gain proficiency with
    light armour, quarterstaffs and daggers.

\subsection{Class Features}
As a psion, you gain the following features.

\subsubsection{Hit Points}

\listparagraph[4pt]{Hit Dice}{
    1d6 per psion level
}
\listparagraph{Hit Points at 1st Level}{
    6 + your Constitution modifier
}
\listparagraph{Hit Points at Higher Levels}{

\vspace{6pt}
\listparagraph{Saving Throws}{
    Intelligence, Wisdom
}
\listparagraph{Skills}{
    Choose two from History, Religion, Nature,

}

In addition, depending on the psion's chosen discipline,
they acquire an additional skill proficiency.
This is shown in the table below.
\begin{table}[htbp]%
    \begin{DndTable}[width=\columnwidth,
                     header=Additional Proficiency]{
                     X X}
        Discipline & Proficiency \\
        Prescience & Investigation \\
        Prana Bindu & Athletics, Acrobatics or Stealth \\
        Voice & Persuasion \\
        Metacreativity & Survival \\
        Spacefolding & Arcana \\
        Psychokinesis & Intimidation
    \end{DndTable}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Equipment}
You start with the following equipment,
in addition to the equipment granted by your background:
\begin{itemize}
    \item (a) a club or (b) a dagger
    \item a light crossbow and 20 bolts
    \item (a) a scholar's pack or (b) a dungeoneer's pack
    \item Leather armour
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Powers}
\subsubsection{Psi Dice}
The number of powers that you can manifest
is limited by the number of psi dice that
you have available.
This is the principal limit on the output of a psion.
For example, a 9-th level psion with 24 psi dice
can manifest a power costing 1 psi dice 24 times.

The number of available psi dice per level
is shown in the psion class table.
You regain all expended psi dice when you finish
a long rest.

\subsubsection{Mental Bandwidth}
The powers you can manifest without straining yourself
is reflected by your mental bandwidth.
The total number of mental bandwidth slots you have
is shown in the class table.

\subsubsection{Discipline}
\label{subs:psion_discipline}
At 1st level,
you must decide upon a discipline.
Your discipline grants you a specific sublist of powers
which cannot be accessed by other disciplines.
This is called the \define{discipline sublist}.
These are given at \secref{sub:discipline_sublists}.
In addition, your discipline grants you different abilities
when you reach certain levels.
These are called \define{tenets},
and are given later on in this section.

\subsubsection{Powers Known}
At 1st level,
you choose three psion powers of your choice
from either the psion class power list
or your chosen discipline sublist.
You cannot choose powers from discipline sublists
other than that of the discipline you have nominated.
When you gain a psion level,
you can, subject to the same restrictions,
learn additional powers on top of the ones you already know.
The total numbers of powers you know cannot
exceed your powers known value,
as shown in the class table.

The powers you have selected in this fashion have been committed
to memory, and you need not prepare a selection of them each long rest.
Also,
whenever you take a long rest,
you may substitute any number of powers you already know
for ones you do not know
on the psion class list or your discipline sublist.
The power that has been replaced counts as no longer being known.

\subparagraph{Psionic Threshold}
You cannot learn nor manifest powers with a level
greater than your psionic threshold,
shown in the class table.
As mentioned in \secref{sub:augmenting},
you also cannot augment powers to a level
beyond your psionic threshold.

\subsubsection{Manifesting Ability}
Your psionic ability modifier is your Intelligence modifier.
The save DC against your psionic powers and your
psionic attack modifier are therefore respectively:
\small\begin{equation*}
    \begin{gathered}
        \text{\textbf{Psionics save DC}}
            = 8 + \text{your proficiency bonus} + \\
                  \text{your Intelligence modifier} \\
        \text{\textbf{Psionics attack modifier}}
            = \text{your proficiency bonus} + \\
              \text{your Intelligence modifier}
    \end{gathered}
\end{equation*}\normalsize

\subsection{Microsleep}
Starting at 2nd level,
as a bonus action on your turn,
you may recover a number of psi dice equal to
your Intelligence modifier multiplied by your psionic threshold.

Once you use this feature,
you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.
Starting at 11th level,
you can use it twice before a long rest.

\subsection{Ability Score Improvement}
When you reach 4th level,
and again at 8th, 12th, 16th and 19th level,
you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2,
or you can increase two of your ability scores by 1.
As normal,
you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

\subsection{Mind Palace}
Starting at 7th level,
your mind becomes your sanctuary---a palace constructed
from pure thought.
Whenever you are asleep,
you return to this sanctuary,
which exists in a perfect equilibrium between
external and internal influences.
You are fully alert to your surroundings
while you are asleep.
In addition, you can communicate telepathically to other
creatures who are also sleeping within 30 feet of you,
in which case you appear as a character in their dreams.

\subsection{Ascendance}
Starting at 20th level,
your body becomes only a vessel for the vast potential
of your mind.
Your mind alters your biological makeup to better resist damage,
granting you resistance to bludgeoning, piercing and slashing damage.
In addition,
you no longer age,
but you can still be killed otherwise.

\subsection{Prescience Tenets}

\subsubsection{Precognitive Step}
% phb3(4e) 89
% prescience
Starting at 6th level,
you can peer through the mists obscuring the future,
learning how one event unfolds.
At the start of every encounter, roll a d20.
Once during the same encounter,
you can at any time replace one of your attack rolls,
saving throws or skill checks with that roll,
adding modifiers on top of it as usual.
You can also replace an enemy's attack roll against you.

\subsubsection{Epitaph}
Starting at 10th level,
your hone your ability to see through time.
Once during an encounter,
if a hostile creature takes a turn immediately following yours,
you may use a free action at the start of your turn
to ask the DM once what the creature will do on their turn,
as conditioned by your explicit choices.
For example,
you may ask the DM what the creature will do
if you move 30 feet in a given direction and manifest a power.
If you deviate at all from your stated conditions,
or if you leave any ambiguity or uncertainty as to those choices,
the prediction may not necessarily come true.
If you do exactly as you say,
the creature is bound to act in exactly the way the DM described.

If multiple hostile creatures follow your turn,
you may use this ability for each of those creatures
until the turn order reaches a friendly creature
or the round ends.

\subsubsection{Other Memory}
Starting at 14th level,
your unlock the hereditary memories of your forebears,
allowing you to use their knowledge in your time of need.
Once per day, as an action you may call upon a particular ancestor
with a certain background as shown in the table below.
The nature of the benefit conferred to you depends on the background.
The benefits conferred to you end when you finish a long rest.

\begin{table}[htbp]%
    \begin{DndTable}[width=\columnwidth,
                     header=Other Memory Benefit]{
                     l X}
        Background          & Benefit                                                                   \\
        Warrior             & Gain proficiency in all armours,
                                martial weapons and Strength (Athletics) \\
        Battlemage          & You learn three 5th-level or lower
                                evocation spells of your choice
                                which can be cast without expending a spell slot;
                                once you cast any of these spells,
                                you can't cast the same spell again;
                                the spellcasting ability for these
                                spells is Intelligence \\
        Commander           & You learn three Uberium faction abilities \\
        Thief               & You gain an extra bonus action \\ 
        Priest              & You learn three 5th-level or lower
                                spells from the cleric spell list
                                of your choice;
                                these can be cast without expending a spell slot;
                                once you cast any of these spells,
                                you can't cast the same spell again;
                                the spellcasting ability for these
                                spells is Intelligence \\\
        Musician            & You gain proficiency in a musical instrument
                                and Charisma (Performance), or expertise if
                                you are already proficient in that skill
    \end{DndTable}
\end{table}

If you spend subsequent days relying on the same ancestor
and their abilities,
you run the risk of them usurping your personality.
For each consecutive day you use the same ancestor,
make a Wisdom saving throw with DC equal to 10 plus the number
of consecutive days.
This roll cannot be influenced by any Prescience powers
or other abilities which allow you to replace rolls.
If you fail the save,
hand your character sheet to the DM and roll a new character.

\subsection{Prana Bindu Tenets}
\label{sub:prana_bindu_tenets}

\subsubsection{Lightning Warfare}
Starting at 6th level,
your mastery of nerve and muscle
allows you to move at incredible speeds.
Your movement speed increases by 20 ft.
In addition, your movement no longer provokes
opportunity attacks.

\subsubsection{Optimised Reflexes}
Starting at 10th level,
your reaction times become almost negligible.
You gain an additional reaction on top of the one
you already have, which can be used in the same way
as the latter.

\subsubsection{Alter Metabolism}
Starting at 14th level,
your mastery over body now extends to your metabolism,
and you are able to by thought alone
alter the chemical makeup of malign substances.
You become immune to the effects of all poisons,
poison damage, the poisoned condition, and any toxic venoms
or secretions.
You also gain resistance to acid damage,
and you become immune to disease.

Additionally, you become immune to the maluses of extreme heat,
extreme cold and high altitude,
unless the conditions are so severe
that the DM decides otherwise.

\subsection{Voice Tenets}

\subsubsection{Inner Voice}
Starting at 6th level,
you gain telepathy up to 120 feet.
Once per day,
you may also send a message up to 10 words long
to a creature you have seen before and that is
presently within 24 miles of you.

Additionally,
after you have communicated telepathically with a creature
and that creature is the target of a Voice power with the Speech
requirement that you manifest,
the creature no longer needs to be able to understand you.

\subsubsection{Subtle Voice}
Starting at 10th level,
your mastery of the Voice allows you to manifest Voice
powers without arousing suspicion.
Any Voice power with the Speech requirement,
therefore producing an audible effect
(see \secref{subs:voice_powers}),
now is indistinguishable from normal speech.
Namely,
creatures which would ordinarily be alerted
to your Voice by distinguishing it from normal speech
now no longer are.
\emph{Exception:} Psions who have chosen the Voice discipline
cannot be affected by Subtle Voice.

\subsubsection{Enthrall Creature}
Starting at 14th level,
you gain the ability to dominate other creatures and have them
carry out your bidding.
Twice per day,
you may manifest the \spell{geas} spell as a power,
which counts as a 5th-level Voice power with no PD or MB cost.
Subtle Voice also applies for this power.

\subsection{Metacreativity Tenets}
\label{sub:metacreativity_tenets}
\subsubsection{Create Golem}
\label{subs:menu_a}
Starting at 6th level,
you learn the \nameref{pwr:psionic_golem} power,
which allows you to manifest a psionic golem
from mundane matter.
You are mentally linked to the psionic golem,
and they answer to your bidding as described in the power.
The statistics of the golem depend on the level
at which \nameref{pwr:psionic_golem} is cast.
For example,
casting the power at 3rd-level creates a 3rd-level psionic golem.
The statblocks by golem level are given in \secref{sec:psionic_golem}.

\begin{table}[htbp]%
    \begin{DndTable}[width=\columnwidth,
                     header=Psionic Golem Abilities (Menu A)]{

        Resilient           & The golem gains an extra 10 hit points \\
        Sturdy              & The golem gains a +2 bonus to its AC \\
        Vertical Propulsion & The golem gains a fly speed equal to 15 feet \\ 
        Celerity            & The golem gains the mobile feat \\
        Resistance          & The golem gains resistance to fire, lightning, cold
                                or thunder damage \\
        Seaworthy           & The golem gains a swim speed of 30 feet \\
        Aggressive          & If the golem hits a creature with a melee attack,
                                it can use its reaction to attempt to shove
                                that creature prone
    \end{DndTable}
\end{table}

Each manifested golem has a certain number of
\define{metacreative points} (MP).
This is called the \define{MP potential} of the golem.
Metacreative points allow you to augment the golem
with particular abilities.
At 6th level,
you have access to the abilities given in Menu A
(see the corresponding table),
all of which have an MP cost of 1.
You cannot add abilities to the golem such that the total MP cost
is above the MP potential of the golem.
For example,
a 4th-level golem with an MP potential of 2
can have two Menu A abilities.
You may only choose each ability once.

\subsubsection{Improved Psionic Golem}
\label{subs:menu_b}
Starting at 10th level,
you gain access to psionic golem abilities on Menu B,
as shown in the table below.
The abilities on Menu B cost 2 MP.

\begin{table}[htbp]%
    \begin{DndTable}[width=\columnwidth,
                     header=Psionic Golem Abilities (Menu B)]{
                     l X}
        Name                & Benefit   \\
        Energy Touch        & The golem deals an extra 1d4 points of
                                fire, cold, electricity or thunder damage when it
                                hits with a melee attack \\
        Extra Attack        & Whenever the golem takes the \define{Multiattack} action,
                                it can make one additional slam attack \\
        Auto-reassembly     & The golem heals 5 hit points each round \\ 
        Heavy Deflection    & The golem gains a +4 bonus to its AC  \\
        Highly Resilient    & The golem gains an extra 20 hit points \\
        Improved Critical   & The golem lands a critical hit on a roll of either
                                19 or 20 \\
        Muscular            & The golem gains a +4 bonus to its Strength score \\
    \end{DndTable}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Heart of Ascension}
\label{subs:menu_c}
Starting at 14th level,
any golem you manifest with \nameref{pwr:psionic_golem}
becomes Ascendant.
You gain access to psionic golem abilities on Menu C,
as shown in the table below.
The abilities on Menu C cost 4 MP.

\begin{table}[htbp]%
    \begin{DndTable}[width=\columnwidth,
                     header=Psionic Golem Abilities (Menu C)]{
                     l X}

        Metal Carapace      & All incoming damage from separate sources
                                is reduced by 5 \\ 
        Shield!             & The golem gains a +6 bonus to its AC \\
        Active Camouflage   & The golem becomes naturally invisible \\
        Energy Bolt         & The golem can manifest the \nameref{pwr:energy_bolt} power
                                as an action once per round; the energy type is
                                chosen when the golem is initially manifested
    \end{DndTable}
\end{table}

\subsection{Spacefolding Tenets}
\subsubsection{Length Contraction}
Starting at 6th level,
you become capable of dramatically contracting the space between you
and another creature with your mind alone. 
Choose a creature you can see within 60 feet and spend 3 psi dice.
That creature is pulled up to 30 feet in your direction as the space
between you and them is eliminated.

\subsubsection{Wormhole}
Starting at 10th level,
you alter the fabric of space and time such that
you can link two different locations together.
Once per day as an action,
you may create a wormhole mouth at a point you are standing on.
The mouth is a 10-foot radius sphere and is presently closed.
At a later point in time,
you may create another mouth at a different location.
The location need not be on the same plane of existence
as the mouth.
When you do so, the two mouths become adjacent to each other.
Creatures on either side can see to the other side of the wormhole
through the 10-foot sphere,
and can step through using their movement.

You may choose to collapse the wormhole at any time.
However, it is not stable.
For every hour that has elapsed since you placed the second mouth,
roll a d10.
On a roll of 1--5,
the wormhole collapses and the bridge between the two locations
is lost.
You must then create a new wormhole.

\subsubsection{Master of Spacetime}
Starting at 14th level,
you can effortlessly warp space and time locally to
move yourself across the battlefield.
The \nameref{pwr:psionic_step} power costs no psi dice
and occupies no mental bandwidth slots
whenever you manifest it.
The power still costs 4 psi dice to augment,
however if you do so,
you can manifest the power as a free action
instead of a bonus action
(limit of once per turn).

\subsection{Psychokinesis Tenets}
\subsubsection{Sculpt Psioncs}
Starting at 6th level,
akin to the evocation wizard's ability to sculpt spells,
you can alter the direction that hazardous effects
created by your psychokinesis powers propagate.
When you manifest a psychokinesis power that affects
other creatures that you can see,
you can choose a number of them equal to your
psionic threshold.
The chosen creatures automatically succeed on any saving
throws they make to resist the power,
taking no damage on a successful save if they would
otherwise take half.
If the power does not prompt a saving throw
(e.g. if it automatically hits),
the chosen creatures also take no damage.

\subsubsection{Signature Damage}
Starting at 10th level,
you become highly proficient in dealing damage
with a specific energy manifested by your psionic powers.
Choose a damage type from fire, cold, lightning and thunder.
Each die of damage you deal with the chosen type
become \define{exploding die}.
If you roll the maximum result on an exploding die,
you can reroll that die again and add the result to the
total damage.
If the result is again the maximum,
you may `explode' the die again.
This continues until you no
longer rolled the maximum value over all dice.

\subsubsection{Signature Power}
Starting at 14th level,
one psychokinesis power becomes so familiar to you that you
manifest it without straining yourself.
Choose one 3rd-level psychokinesis power.
The MB cost for that power is reduced to 0 whenever you manifest it.
In addition, you can manifest this power without expending
any psi die.
Once you do so,
you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

\clearpage\section{Psi Knight}
\label{sec:psi_knight}
\DndSetThemeColor[DmgCoral]
With a thought alone, the silver-armoured half-orc effortlessly
shunts aside the first gnoll before plunging his longsword
into the abdomen of the next.
Then, with near-imperceptible speed, he appears behind the third gnoll,
who scarcely processes the gruesome end he meets.

In the silver-purple depths of the Astral Plane,
the githyanki astral skiff careens into the illithid nautiloid.
Before long, the erstwhile slaves of shattered Astromundi Nova
engage the mind flayers,
battling each other with thoughts alone.
Then the githyanki vanguard charges,
their silver swords slicing into the exposed flesh of their former
masters.

In the subterranean halls of a long-forgotten city,
the elf uses her mind to propel herself across a seemingly
bottomless crevasse.
Then, landing on the other side,
she shapes the very earth itself into a glowing handaxe,
which she picks up and throws at the awakened undead
bearing down upon her.

In the great open-air arena of Pax Illium,
the Prana Bindu champion bathes in the swelling roar
of the audience.
He fights with no weapon nor armour,
but with fist and mind alone.
Without any sign of strain,
he shoves a grappled gladiator to the floor
before delivering a swift kick into the abdomen of another,
careening them through through the electrified air.
The sound of their impact into the blood-soaked sand
is scarcely heard above the crowd's cheers.

\subsection{The Body and the Mind}
Psi Knights supplement their martial abilities
with the latent power of their mind to
achieve victory over their enemies.
Formidable opponents,
psi knights are rare and highly accomplished warriors
who reach an almost unparalleled balance between mind
and body.
Adventuring parties often readily accept a noble psi knight
by their side,
and the psi knight's enemies on the battlefield tremble
as they approach.

Like psions, psi knights manifest powers with myriad effects.
While they cannot manifest as many powers as psions,
they have substantial martial capacity
and have a greater ability to weather the tide of battle. 

\subsubsection{Creating a Psi Knight}
When creating a psi knight,
ask yourself why your character has chosen the path of psionics.
Perhaps they belonged to a small community of like-minded warriors
who understood the untapped potential of psionic powers.
Or perhaps they ventured down a solitary path,
testing the powers they learnt piecemeal in the din of battle.

Also ask yourself how they interact with the broader community.
Do they see themselves as an ordinary person with a fortuitous
talent?
Or do they feel that they rise above the masses?

\subsubsection{Quick Build}
You can make a psi knight quickly by following these suggestions.
First, Strength or Dexterity should be your highest ability score,
followed by Wisdom then Constitution.
Second, choose the soldier background.
Third, pick the \nameref{pwr:boots_of_the_demon_king} power
from the psi knight class power list.

\begin{DndSidebar}[float=htbp]{Multiclassing with the Psi Knight}
    \tocside{Multiclassing with the Psi Knight}In order to
    multiclass into the psi knight class,
    a character must have a minimum Strength or Dexterity score of 13
    and a minimum Wisdom score of 13
    (in addition to the usual score requirement for their base class).
    When you multiclass into the psi knight class,
    you gain proficiency with
    light armour, medium armour, shields, simple weapons
    and martial weapons.

\subsection{Class Features}
As a psi knight, you gain the following features.

\subsubsection{Hit Points}

\listparagraph[4pt]{Hit Dice}{
    1d10 per psi knight level
}
\listparagraph{Hit Points at 1st Level}{
    10 + your Constitution modifier
}
\listparagraph{Hit Points at Higher Levels}{
    1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per psion level
    after 1st
}

\subsubsection{Proficiencies}

\listparagraph[4pt]{Armour}{
    All armour, shields
}
\listparagraph{Weapons}{
    Simple weapons, martial weapons
}
\listparagraph{Tools}{
    None
}
\vspace{6pt}
\listparagraph{Saving Throws}{
    Constitution, Wisdom
}
\listparagraph{Skills}{
    Choose two from Athletics, Acrobatics, Insight,
    Perception, Animal Handling, Intimidation
    and Survival
}

\subsubsection{Equipment}
You start with the following equipment,
in addition to the equipment granted by your background:
\begin{itemize}
    \item (a) chain mail or
          (b) leather armour, a longbow
            and 20 arrows
    \item (a) a martial weapon and a shield or
          (b) two martial weapons
    \item (a) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or
          (b) two handaxes
    \item (a) a dungeoneer's pack or
          (b) an explorer's pack
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Fighting Style}
You adopt a particular fighting style as your specialty.
Choose one of the following options.
You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once,
even if you later get to choose again.

\subsubsection{Blind Fighting}
You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet.
Within that range, you can effectively see anything that
isn't behind total cover,
even if you're blinded or in darkness.
Moreover, you can see an invisible creature within that range,
unless the creature successfully hides from you.

\subsubsection{Defence}
While you are wearing armour, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

\subsubsection{Dueling}
When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand
and no other weapons,
you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

\subsubsection{Great Weapon Fighting}
When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make
with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands,
you can reroll the die and must use the new roll,
even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2.
The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property
for you to gain this benefit.

\subsubsection{Interception}
When a creature you can see hits a target,
other than you,
within 5 feet of you with an attack,
you can use your reaction to reduce the damage the target takes
by 1d10 + your proficiency bonus (to a minimum of 0 damage).
You must be wielding a shield or a simple or martial weapon
to use this reaction.

\subsubsection{Protection}
When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you
that is within 5 feet of you,
you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll.
You must be wielding a shield.

\subsection{Powers}
\subsubsection{Psi Dice}
The number of powers that you can manifest
is limited by the number of psi dice that
you have available.
This is the principal limit on the psionic output of a psi knight.
For example, a 9-th level psi knight with {\pklvlnine} psi dice
can manifest a power costing 1 psi dice {\pklvlnine} times.

The number of available psi dice per level
is shown in the psion class table.
You regain all expended psi dice when you finish
a long rest.

\subsubsection{Mental Bandwidth}
The powers you can manifest without straining yourself
is reflected by your mental bandwidth.
The total number of mental bandwidth slots you have
is shown in the class table.

\subsubsection{Powers Known}
At 1st level,
you choose one psion power of your choice
from the psi knight class power list.
When you gain a psi knight level,
you can learn additional powers from the class list
on top of the ones you already know.
The total numbers of powers you know cannot
exceed your powers known value,
as shown in the class table.

The powers you have selected in this fashion have been committed
to memory, and you need not prepare a selection of them each long rest.
Also,
whenever you take a long rest,
you may substitute any number of powers you already know
for ones you do not know on the psi knight class list.
The power that has been replaced counts as no longer being known.

\subparagraph{Psionic Threshold}
You cannot learn nor manifest powers with a level
greater than your psionic threshold,
shown in the class table.
As mentioned in \secref{sub:augmenting},
you also cannot augment powers to a level
beyond your psionic threshold.

\subsubsection{Manifesting Ability}
Your psionic ability modifier is your Wisdom modifier.
The save DC against your psionic powers and your
psionics attack modifier are therefore respectively:
\small\begin{equation*}
    \begin{gathered}
        \text{\textbf{Psionics save DC}}
            = 8 + \text{your proficiency bonus} + \\
                  \text{your Wisdom modifier} \\
        \text{\textbf{Psionics attack modifier}}
            = \text{your proficiency bonus} + \\
              \text{your Wisdom modifier}
    \end{gathered}
\end{equation*}\normalsize

\subsection{Prana Bindu Initiate}
Starting at 2nd level,
your mind-body training makes manifesting powers
belonging to the Prana Bindu discipline
vastly easier.
Prana Bindu powers require one less mental bandwidth slot
than mentioned in their description (minimum of 0)
and cost 1 less psi die (minimum of 0).
If the psi dice cost is reduced to zero in this manner,
it is called a \define{0PD power}.
You can only manifest a number of 0PD powers
equal to your proficiency bonus per long rest.
Each additional 0PD power you manifest
beyond this limit costs the usual 1 psi die.

\subsection{Psionic Tradition}
When you reach 3rd level,
you embark on a journey down a particular
psionic tradition.
The tradition represents the aspects of
your mind-body mastery that you have decided
to focus on.
At this stage, two traditions are offered:
the Weirding Way, which focuses on your mastery
of devastatingly precise and supremely fast
Prana Bindu techniques,
and the Commander,
who couples their experience in battle
with profound psionic powers to meticulously
plan and execute combat stratagems.
Your tradition grants you features at 3rd level,
and again at 6th, 10th, 15th and 18th level.

\subsection{Ability Score Improvement}
When you reach 4th level,
and again at 8th, 12th, 16th and 19th level,
you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2,
or you can increase two of your ability scores by 1.
As normal,
you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

\subsection{Power Nap}
Starting at 4th level,
you may enter a state of meditation
in which you refresh your mind.
The meditation lasts 1 minute and
you must maintain concentration throughout.
If you do so,
at the end of the meditation you may regain a number of psi dice
equal to your Wisdom modifier multiplied by your psionic threshold.
You cannot accumulate psi dice past the maximum number you have available
as per your class(es) and level.

Once you have used this feature,
you cannot use it again until you have finished a long rest.

\subsection{Extra Attack}
Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice,
instead of once,
whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

\subsection{Iron Will}
Starting at 7th level,
your mind is able to override your body at times
when the untrained would falter.
Whenever you are reduced to hit points,
but not killed outright,
you can spend a psi die to immediately regain hit points
equal to your Wisdom modifier plus the number of levels
you have in the psi knight class.
Once you have used this feature,
you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.

\subsection{Calmness of Self}
Starting at 11th level,
your unfettered desire to improve mind and body
has granted you a sense of inner calm.
You have resistance to psychic damage.
Moreover, if you start your turn charmed or frightened,
you can expend 3 psi dice and end every effect on yourself
subjecting you to those conditions.
In addition, you have advantage on saving throws to resist
effects from Voice psionic powers.

\subsection{Psionic Reserve}
Starting at 20th level,
when you roll for initiative and have no psi dice remaining,
you regain 8 psi dice.

\subsection{Weirding Way}
The Weirding Way champions incredible control over one's nerves
and reaction times---granted by Prana Bindu techniques---to
manoeuvre and strike at opponents before they can retaliate.
The name `Weirding Way' comes from the fact that,
to untrained opponents, the movements of those versed in
the Weirding Way appear unnatural and superhuman,
almost as if they are teleporting across the battlefield.

\subsubsection{Prana Bindu Prodigy}
Starting at 3rd level,
you can choose to learn any Prana Bindu tenet from
the psion discipline at \secref{sub:prana_bindu_tenets}.
The level requirements stated there do not apply to you.

\subsubsection{Seize the Initiative}
Starting at 6th level,
whenever a fight breaks out,
you can reliably act before your enemies.
If you spend a psi die,
you can grant yourself advantage on an initiative roll.

\subsubsection{CQC Dominance}
Starting at 10th level,
you make quick use of off-hand and blunt strikes to
achieve dominance in CQC (`close quarters combat').
You have advantage on all checks when taking the
grapple, shove, shove aside, or overrun action.

In addition,
whenever a creature within 5 feet of you ends their turn,
you can use your reaction and spend a psi die
to make a single attack against that creature.
The damage type is replaced with bludgeoning damage,
since you use your off-hand,
a kick, a punch or the blunt end of your weapon
to make the attack.
Whether or not the attack is made with a weapon
or is an unarmed attack is your choice.

\subsubsection{Slippery Movement}
Starting at 15th level,
your incredible agility makes its difficult for your
enemies to pin you down.
You have advantage on all saving throws against effects
which would slow your movement or reduce it to 0.
In addition,
if you become restrained or grappled,
you can use a bonus action on your turn
to attempt to repeat the save
or contest respectively which caused that condition.
You have advantage on this save.

\subsubsection{Lisan al Gaib}
Starting at 18th level,
your perfection of Prana Bindu methods becomes legendary,
and in the eyes of many your are considered a
sublime master of the body and mind.
You may pick an additional Prana Bindu tenet from
\secref{sub:prana_bindu_tenets}.

\subsection{Commander}
The Commander uses their experience and psionic abilities
to control and manipulate the battlefield as they desire.
Enemies fear a psi knight commander,
for they know that they will struggle to ever
gain tactical advantage over them and their allies.

\subsubsection{Wise Strikes}
Starting at 3rd level,
your battlefield experience ensures that your attacks
are as damaging as they can be for your enemy.
You may add your Wisdom modifier to all damage
rolls for melee attacks. 

\subsubsection{Knowledge is Power}
Starting at 6th level,
once per day as a bonus action,
you choose a hostile creature you can see within
30 feet of you.
Your mind links with them,
and you gain a deep understanding of their
strengths, weaknesses and peculiarities.
You may then ask the DM the exact amount of any of the following
characteristics of the hostile creature:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Its full stat array;
    \item Its AC;
    \item Its total hit points;
    \item Its to-hit modifier on one type of attack; or,
    \item Its damage roll, including modifiers, for one type
            of attack.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Order of Battle}
Starting at 10th level,
your mind's eye expands,
and you begin to see the battlefield from a top-down perspective.
Enemies and allies are pieces on a board, which you can manipulate
with thought alone.
Once per day,
immediately after initiative is rolled at the start of an encounter,
you may attempt to declare the initiative order for
any number of combatants.
For each creature you intend to affect,
they must make a Wisdom saving throw against your psionics save DC.
If they fail, you may replace their initiative with any number.
If they succeed, their initiative is unaffected. 

This ability does not apply when you are surprised.
You also cannot alter the initiative order of creatures
in the encounter that you have no knowledge of,
those that join later in the fight (such as those
that are summoned),
and environmental effects or lair actions
which act on a set initiative count.

\subsubsection{Gambit}
Starting at 15th level,
your see fighters on a battlefield as pieces on a chessboard
that can be effortlessly manipulated---you simply turn your
mind to them, and they bend to your will.
You have a pool of 120 feet of movement.
On your turn,
you may use your action to attempt to move any number of creatures
cumulatively up to 120 feet in any direction,
including vertically.
Each creature you wish to move can resist this movement by
succeeding a Wisdom saving throw with DC equal to your
psionics save DC.

Any unspent movement remaining in your pool persists
and can be carried over to subsequent turns.
Your pool of movement replenishes whenever you finish a long rest.

\subsubsection{Only a Simulation}
Sometimes the tide of battle can be unpredictable.
Fortunately for you,
starting at 18th level,
your supreme mental abilities confer you the ability to
run combat simulations viewed internally by your mind's eye.
These simulations allow you to decide the best course of action.

Once per day, on your turn,
you can use an action to undo the previous round of combat,
allowing you to `replay' that round.
This ability reverses time to the point in the past
just prior to your previous turn,
undoing the effects of everyone else's actions in the meantime.
Once you have used Only a Simulation,
only you retain knowledge of what happened during the round
that is being replayed; after all, it was just a simulation.
However, you can communicate that knowledge verbally to your companions,
if desired,
and you can act on that privileged knowledge
in any way you desire.

\section{Psion/Psi Knight Multiclassing}
\label{sec:psion_psi_knight_multiclassing}
There is the possibility that a character chooses to multiclass
into both the psion and psi knight classes.
If this is the case,
the following rules apply with respect to the Powers feature
of each class.
\subparagraph{Psi Dice}
    Psi dice add cumulatively between the two classes.
    For example,
    if a character has 3 levels in psion (6 psi dice)
    and then multiclass into psi knight,
    they would gain 1 psi dice,
    since at first level the psi knight starts at 1 psi dice.
    If they took a further level in psi knight,
    they would gain 1 psi dice,
    and so on.
\subparagraph{Mental Bandwidth}
    Your mental bandwidth is the highest mental bandwidth you
    have across both classes.
\subparagraph{Powers Known}
    The same logic as for psi dice applies for
    determining the number of powers you know.
\subparagraph{Psionic Threshold}
    The same logic as for mental bandwidth applies for
    determining your psionic threshold.

\section{Feats}
\label{sec:feats}
This section adds the following feats on top of the already
existing ones.

\DndFeatHeader{Psionics Initiate}[%
    Prerequisite: Wisdom 13 (psi knight); Intelligence 13 (psion)]
    Choose either the psi knight or psion class.
    You learn two 1st-level powers from the powers list
    (see \secref{sec:class_lists})
    of that class assuming you meet the prerequisites
    for the nominated class given above.
    Each power counts as a (1/day) innate talent for you.

    Your psionics ability for these powers depends on the class
    you choose:
    Wisdom for the psi knight class; Intelligence for the psion class.

\DndFeatHeader{Voice Resistance}[%
    Prerequisite: None]
    You have trained extensively and rigorously in the ways
    of resisting the dominating effects of the Voice.
    You gain advantage on all saving throws against
    Voice powers.
    You also know whenever a Voice power is manifested,
    even if the manifester has the \emph{Subtle Voice} ability.

\DndFeatHeader{Psionic Litany}[%
    Prerequisite: The ability to manifest at least one power
]
You have committed a psionic litany to memory, granting you respite
and focus in fear-inducing and hostile conditions.
You gain advantage on Constitution saving throws that you make
to maintain concentration on powers.
This applies when you take damage
or are otherwise subject to a condition which
threatens your concentration.

\section{Races}
\label{sec:races}
This section makes the following changes to the racial traits
of creatures in the base game.

\subsection{Gith}
\subsubsection{Githyanki}
\emph{Githyanki Psionics} is replaced as follows.
\subparagraph{Githyanki Psionics}
    Your psionic heritage grants you a limited selection of
    psionic powers as innate talents.    
    You know the \nameref{pwr:psi_hand} power (3/day innate talent).
    Starting at 3rd level,
    you can manifest the \nameref{pwr:leap} power (1/day innate talent).
    Starting at 5th level,
    you can manifest the \nameref{pwr:psionic_step} power (1/day innate talent).
    Intelligence or Wisdom is your psionics ability for these powers
    (choose when you select this race).
    If you select the psion or psi knight class,
    the psionics ability becomes the underlying ability
    associated with manifesting powers for that class.

    Each innate talent also counts as powers known for you,
    so, if you wish,
    you can manifest these powers using psi dice if you have any.

\subsubsection{Githzerai}
\emph{Githzerai Psionics} is replaced as follows.
\subparagraph{Githzerai Psionics}
    Your psionic heritage grants you a limited selection of
    psionic powers as innate talents.    
    You know the \nameref{pwr:psi_hand} power (3/day innate talent).
    Starting at 3rd level,
    you know the \nameref{pwr:sacrificial_shell} power or the
    \nameref{pwr:detect_thoughts_psionic} power.
    Each count as a 1/day innate talent.
    Starting at 5th level,
    you know the \nameref{pwr:leap} power (1/day innate talent).

    Intelligence or Wisdom is your psionics ability for these powers
    (choose when you select this race).
    If you select the psion or psi knight class,
    the psionics ability becomes the underlying ability
    associated with manifesting powers for that class.

    Each innate talent also counts as powers known for you,
    so, if you wish,
    you can manifest these powers using psi dice if you have any.

\section{Psionic Traits}
\label{sec:psionic_traits}
The following section outlines special traits relating to psionics
that a creature might possess.

\subsection{Power Resistance}
\label{sub:power_resistance}
When a creature with \define{power resistance} is the target of
or is affected by a psionic power, whether manifested normally or
as an innate talent, or is the target of or affected by a psi-like ability,
that creature has a chance of resisting the power or ability's effects.
This chance is reflected in the value of the power resistance,
denoted as power resistance ($x$) or PR$x$.

When the conditions for power resistance are met,
the creature manifesting the power or using the psi-like ability
must make a d20 check with a DC equal to
the creature's power resistance value, adding their psionics attack modifier
to the roll.
If the check fails, the creature with power resistance
is not affected by the power or psi-like ability.

A creature with power resistance can choose to voluntarily
succumb to the effects of a power or psi-like ability, even if
the check fails.

\section{Psionic Items}
\label{sec:psionic_items}
Some items have an affinity for the minds of others.
Such special items are called \textbf{psionic items},
and are analogous to magic items.
However, unlike magic items,
a psionic item is generally totally inert unless
it is harnessed by a trained psyche.
To such individuals,
psionic items can offer an incredible reserve of power,
as well as great boons which supplement an individual's own powers.

\subsection{Integration}
A magic item is attuned to by its user.
Similarly, a psionic item is \textbf{integrated} by its user;
the psionic powers conferred by a magic item cannot be used
unless it is integrated.
However, the rules for psionic item integration are different to
those for magic item attunement.

\subsubsection{MB Cost}
Each psionic item is associated with a mental bandwidth cost.
While a psionic item is integrated by a user,
a number of mental bandwidth slots equal to the MB cost of the item
are permanently occupied.
In addition, in order to integrate a psionic item,
the user must have available a number of mental bandwidth slots
equal to the MB cost of the item.
A user cannot integrate with a psionic item if, after integration,
all of their mental bandwidth slots are fully occupied.
This calculation includes slots occupied by powers that a manifester
is currently concentrating on.
Thus,
the limit on the number of psionic items a user can integrate
is determined by their mental bandwidth.

For example,
suppose a psion has 2 available mental bandwidth slots.
They have also integrated a psionic item with an MB cost of 1.
Thus, they have only 1 available mental bandwidth slot.
This slot could be occupied by a power or another psionic item,
but not if that psionic item has an MB cost greater than 1.

\subparagraph{0MB Items}
    Some psionic items have an MB cost of 0.
    Such items can be integrated by a user even if they do not
    have any free mental bandwidth slots.
    They can also be integrated by users with no mental bandwidth slots,
    such as those without any levels in psionic classes.

\subsection{Process of Integration}
Assuming a user meets the requirements set out above,
they must spend a short rest concentrating on and maintaining physical contact with
the item in order to integrate it.
The user may not spend hit die during this short rest.
In addition, if at any point the user's concentration is broken,
the integration process is broken and the user must start again.

A user cannot begin the process of integration if another user has already
integrated the item, or if they have already integrated a psionic item
with the same name and/or powers. 

\subparagraph{Ending Integration}
    After integrating a psionic item,
    a user may voluntarily end integration by spending another short rest
    concentrating on the item. As above, the user's concentration must not be
    broken for the duration of the short rest for this process to succeed.
