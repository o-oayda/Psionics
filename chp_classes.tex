\DndDropCapLine{H}{ere, two psionics users are}
presented: the psion at \secref{sec:psion} and the psi knight at
\secref{sec:psi_knight}.
The psion is a full user of psionics,
focusing nearly exclusively on their mental prowess
to manifest devastatingly effective powers.
They have access to the largest number of powers,
and can hone their talent further by specialising
in a particular discipline.
The psi knight is a martial warrior
who supplements their fighting ability with
psionics.
This makes them a highly versatile and formidable
opponent on the battlefield.
