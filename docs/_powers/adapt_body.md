**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour\
**Requirements:** None

Your body automatically adapts to hostile
environments. You can adapt to underwater, extremely hot,
extremely cold, or airless environments, allowing you to survive
as if you were a creature native to that environment. You
can breathe and move (though penalties to movement and attacks,
if any for a particular environment, remain), and you take
no damage simply from being in that environment. You need
not specify what environment you are adapting to when you
manifest this power; simply activate it, and your body will
instantly adapt to any hostile environment as needed throughout
the duration.

You can somewhat adapt to extreme environmental features such
as acid, lava, fire, and lightning. Any environmental feature
that normally deals damage to you deals
you only half the usual amount of damage.

In any case, you have advantage on Constitution saving throws
to maintain concentration on powers if damage or an otherwise
hazardous effect from the environment you are adapting to
prompted the save.
