Your Voice plants a compelling attraction
in the mind of a creature you can see and that can hear
and understand you.
The attraction can be toward a particular person or an object.

The target makes a Wisdom saving throw. If the target fails,
they will take reasonable steps to meet, get close to, attend,
or find the object of its implanted attraction. Otherwise,
the power has no effect.

For the purpose of this power, `reasonable' means that, while
attracted, the target doesn't suffer from blind obsession.
They will act on this attraction only when not engaged in
combat. The target won't perform obviously suicidal actions.
They can still recognize danger but will not flee unless the
threat is immediate.

If you make the target feel an attraction to yourself, you
can't command them indiscriminately, although they will be
willing to listen to you (even if they disagree). Accordingly,
this power grants you advantage on any social skill checks
you make involving the target.
