**Manifesting Time:** 1 action\
**Range:** 30 feet\
**Cost:** MB 2, PD 3\
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour\
**Requirements:** Speech, Sight

Your Voice plants a powerful aversion in
the mind of a creature you can see in range
and that can hear and understand you. If the object
of the implanted aversion is an individual or a physical object,
the target will prefer not to approach within 30 feet of it.
If it is a word, they will try not to utter it; if it is an
action, they will not willingly attempt to perform it; and
if it is an event, they will not willingly attend it. The
subject will take reasonable steps to avoid the object of
its aversion, but will not put themselves in jeopardy by doing
so.

If the subject is forced into taking an action they have an
aversion to, they have disadvantage on any attack rolls, ability
checks, or skill checks involved.
