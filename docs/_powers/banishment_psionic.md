# Banishment, Psionic
*4th-level Spacefolding*\
**Manifesting Time:** 1 action\
**Range:** 120 feet\
**Cost:** MB 4, PD 7\
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute\
**Requirements:** Sight

You warp space and time,
attempting to force a creature to return back to their
native plane of existence.
The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw,
otherwise they succumb to the effects described below.

If the target is native to the plane of existence you are on,
they are transported to a pocket dimension just large enough
to encompass their physical size.
The pocket dimension is harmless,
and the target is free to take actions as normal.
The target remains there until the power ends,
in which case they return to the space they previously occupied
before being banished or, if that space is occupied,
the nearest unoccupied space.

If the target is not native to the plane of existence you are on,
the target is shunted through space and returned to its home plane.
The target has a limited degree of control on its homewards journey,
and, if they succeed on another Charisma saving throw,
may choose the rough location of their arrival.
If the power ends before 1 minute has passed,
the target returns in the same way as described in the foregoing paragraph.
Otherwise,
the target does not return.
