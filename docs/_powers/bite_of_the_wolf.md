You temporarily alter your genomic makeup
such that your posture becomes stooped forward, and you grow
a muzzle complete with fangs. You gain one bite attack each
round which can be used as a bonus action or as a replacement
for one of your attacks. Treat the bite as a melee weapon
attack. The bite deals 1d8 piercing damage (assuming you are
a Medium creature) when it hits. Your bite can be affected
by powers, spells, and effects that enhance or improve weapons.

If you are not a Medium creature, your bite attack's base
damage varies as follows: Tiny 1d4; Small 1d6; Large 2d6;
Huge 2d8; Gargantuan 4d6.

Based on your psi knight level, your bite increases in ferocity
as noted here: at 5th level your bite deals an extra 1d8 points
of damage, at 10th level an extra 2d8, at 15th level an extra
3d8, and at 20th level an extra 4d8 points.
