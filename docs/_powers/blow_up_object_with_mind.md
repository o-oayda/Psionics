# Blow Up Object With Mind
*1st-level Psychokinesis*\
**Manifesting Time:** 1 action\
**Range:** 60 feet\
**Cost:** MB 1, PD 1\
**Duration:** Instantaneous\
**Requirements:** Sight

Your terrifying mental ability can cause
matter to wrench itself apart. Choose an object within range
that you can see. The object can be carried or worn by a
creature. Make a psionics attack roll against the object.
The AC is determined by the size of object, shown below.
\begin{table}[htbp]%
  \begin{DndTable}[width=\columnwidth,
               header=Object AC and Damage]{X c c}
    Size & AC & Damage Die \\
    Tiny (bottle, pancakes)        & 11 & 2d6 \\
    Small (chest, lute, sword)     & 13 & 2d8 \\
    Medium (barrel, chandelier)    & 15 & 2d10 \\
    Large (cart, 10x10 ft. window) & 17 & 2d12
  \end{DndTable}
\end{table}

If the attack hits,
the object explodes. Any creature within 10 feet of the
object must make a Dexterity saving throw. If they fail,
they take bludgeoning damage equal to the damage shown in
the table below, as dependent on the object's size.
Otherwise, they take half that amount of damage.
If the object was being worn or carried by a creature,
that creature has disadvantage on the saving throw.
