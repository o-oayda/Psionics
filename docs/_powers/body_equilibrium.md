You can adjust your body's equilibrium to
correspond with any solid or liquid that you stand on. Thus,
you can walk on water, quicksand, or even a spider's web
without sinking or breaking through (this effect does not
confer any resistance to particularly sticky webs). You can
move at your normal speed, but you cannot take the Dash action
on an non-firm surface without sinking or breaking through.

If you fall from any height while using this power, damage
from the impact is halved.
