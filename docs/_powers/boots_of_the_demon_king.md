Your legs briefly gain incredible strength,
and your boots crackle with lightning. You make a kick (unarmed
attack) against an opponent within your melee range. If the
attack hits, the target takes damage from your unarmed strike
as normal plus 2d4 lightning damage. If the target is above
half their hit point maximum, they must succeed on a Strength
saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is below half
their hit point maximum, they must succeed on a Strength saving
throw or immediately be sent a distance into the air equal
to your Strength score. They then fall prone and take fall
damage as normal.
