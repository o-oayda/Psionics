Your make yourself completely undetectable
to a target you can see by erasing all awareness of your presence
from its mind. If the target fails a Wisdom saving throw,
this power has the following effects.

First, you are invisible and inaudible to the creature. It
cannot even detect your presence by means of blindsight, scent,
or tremorsense. It cannot pinpoint your location by any means.
\textit{Exception:} Creatures with truesight are still able
to discern your location, and therefore the power has no effect
on them.

Second, the target remains unaware of your actions, provided
you do not make any attacks or cause any obvious or directly
threatening changes in the target's environment. If you
attack the target, the power ends.

If you take an action that creates a sustained and obvious
change in the target's environment---for example, attacking
a creature aside from the target or moving a large or attended
object the target can see---the target immediately repeats
the saving throw against the power. An ally of the target
creature that is able to see or perceive you can warn the
target and thereby grant it another saving throw.
