**Requirements:** Speech, Sight

Your Voice compels a creature to act according
to your wishes. Choose a creature within range that you can see
and that can hear and understand you.
You then suggest a course of activity
limited to no more than five words that that creature is to
take. The course of action can be harmful to the creature
or contrary to its intentions.

The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. The target has
advantage on the saving throw if the course of action is plainly
harmful or against the creature's wishes. If the target fails,
it pursues the course of action to the best of its ability.
The compelled course of action can continue for the entire
duration of the power. If the compelled activity can be completed
in a shorter time, the power ends when the target finishes
what it was asked to do.

You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special
activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest
that a knight give her warhorse to the first beggar she meets.
If the condition isn't met before the power expires, the
activity isn't performed.
