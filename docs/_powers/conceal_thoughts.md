# Conceal Thoughts
*1st-level Voice*\
**Manifesting Time:** 1 action\
**Range:** 30 feet\
**Cost:** MB 1, PD 1\
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour\
**Requirements:** Sight

Choose a target within range that you can
see. You protect the target's thoughts from analysis. While
the duration lasts, the target gains advantage on 
Charisma (Deception) checks against those
attempting to discern their true intentions
with Wisdom (Insight). They also gain advantage on saving
throws against any power or spell used to read their mind
(such as detect thoughts).
