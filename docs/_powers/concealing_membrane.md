# Concealing Membrane
*2nd-level Metacreativity*\
**Manifesting Time:** 1 action\
**Range:** Self\
**Cost:** MB 2, PD 3\
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute\
**Requirements:** Mundane matter

You weave a quasi-real membrane around yourself,
which makes you lightly obscured. You remain visible within
the translucent, amorphous enclosure. This distortion also
grants you half cover thanks to the rippling membrane encasing
your form. You can pick up or drop objects, easily reaching
through the film. Anything you hold is enveloped by the membrane.
Likewise, you can engage in melee, make ranged attacks, and
manifest powers without hindrance.
