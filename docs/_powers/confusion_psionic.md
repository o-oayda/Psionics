# Confusion, Psionic
*3rd-level Voice*\
**Manifesting Time:** 1 action\
**Range:** 90 feet\
**Cost:** MB 3, PD 5\
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute\
**Requirements:** Speech, Sight

Your Voice berates and beleaguers the mind of another creature,
rendering them dazed and confused.
Choose a creature you can see within range that can
hear and understand you.
That creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or
be affected by this power.

An affected creature cannot take reactions.
While the power lasts,
at the start of each of that creature's turns
you hone your Voice in such a way
so as to coarsely influence the actions of the affected creature.
Roll a d6. If the result is 1--5,
choose freely from the table below
to determine the quality of your Voice
and the associated effect on the creature for that turn.
\begin{table}[htbp]%
  \begin{DndTable}[width=\columnwidth,
                   header=Psionic Confusion Effects]{l X}
    Voice Quality & Effect \\
    Grating       & The target takes 2d10 psychic damage \\
    Booming       & The target is deafened \\
    Discordant    & The target uses all their movement to move
                    in a random direction (determined by the roll
                    of a d8) \\
    Frenetic      & The target makes a single melee attack against
                    a randomly determined creature in their reach,
                    if possible \\
    Pacifying     & The target does nothing
  \end{DndTable}
\end{table}
The creature cannot do anything on that turn except for
the relevant effect given above.
If the result is a 6, the creature is unaffected by your Voice
and acts normally (but is still affected by the power).

At the end of an affected creature's turns,
they may repeat the Wisdom saving throw,
ending the power on a success.
