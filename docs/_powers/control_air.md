You have some control over wind speed and
direction. The speed of the wind in empty spaces you can see
within 120 feet of you can
be increased or decreased by up to 10 knots. This power also
gives you the ability to alter the direction of the wind by
as much as 90 degrees.

Powerful enough winds can cause creatures to be knocked prone.
Creatures of size Small or smaller that are subject to winds
between 25--45 knots must succeed on a DC 10 Strength saving
throw or be knocked prone. If they wind speed is greater than
45 knots, this applies to Medium creatures as well (DC 10),
and the DC for size Small or smaller increases by 5.
