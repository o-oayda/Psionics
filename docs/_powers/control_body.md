# Control Body
*4th-level Psychokinesis*\
**Manifesting Time:** 1 action\
**Range:** 60 feet\
**Cost:** MB 4, PD 7\
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute\
**Requirements:** Sight

You psychokinetically control the actions
of any humanoid (including undead or outsiders with a humanoid
physiology) that you can see within range. The target immediately
makes a Strength saving throw, with the power ending if they
succeed and continuing if they fail. Control body doesn't
require mental contact with the target, since you are actually
forcing limb movements independent of the target's mind.
You can force the target to stand up, sit down, walk, turn
around, and so on, but operating the vocal cords is too difficult.
You can also hold the target immobile, rendering it paralysed.
You cannot force the target to manifest powers, cast spells,
or use any special ability that is not a function of just
its body movements. If you lose sight of the target, the effect
of this power ends.

If you force the target to engage in combat, its attack bonus
is equal to your psionics attack bonus, and its bonus on damage
rolls is equal to your psionics ability modifier.
A creature subject to this power cannot take reactions.
The target gains no benefit to its AC from its Dexterity,
but it does gain a bonus to
its AC equal to your Intelligence bonus.

Although the subject's body is under your control, the subject's
mind is not. Creatures capable of taking purely mental actions
(such as manifesting powers) can do so.
