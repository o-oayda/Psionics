# Control Sound
*2nd-level Psychokinesis*\
**Manifesting Time:** 1 action\
**Range:** 60 feet\
**Cost:** MB 2, PD 3\
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute\
**Requirements:** None

You shape and alter existing sounds. You
can target one sound, such as a person speaking or singing,
or a group of related sounds, such as the patter of many raindrops
or the tramp of soldiers passing by. A sound as quiet as a
snapping finger can be controlled. You can substitute any
sound you have heard for the target sound. If you attempt
to exactly duplicate the voice of a specific individual, or
an inherently terrifying sound (such as a dragon's roar),
you must succeed on a Deception check
(with underlying ability determined by your psionics ability)
opposed by the intended listener's Wisdom (Insight) check
to avoid arousing suspicion.

You can entirely muffle a noise or magnify a sound to such
loudness that it drowns out all other conversation in the
immediate area.

Alternatively, you can use up the power in an instant. You
do this by modulating a sound into a one-time destructive
impetus that shatters nonmagical/nonpsionic unattended objects
of crystal, glass, ceramic, or porcelain make in the area
(e.g. vials, bottles, flasks, jugs, mirrors, and so forth).
