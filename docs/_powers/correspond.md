You forge a mental link with a creature with
which you have previously had physical or mental contact and
that has an Intelligence score of 5 or greater.
The target need not be on the same plane of existence as you.
The target recognises you, and you can mentally
communicate with it for
the duration (though nothing forces the subject to respond
to you), exchanging messages of twenty-five words or less
once per round.
