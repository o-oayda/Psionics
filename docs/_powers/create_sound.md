# Create Sound
*1st-level Metacreativity*\
**Manifesting Time:** 1 action\
**Range:** 30 feet\
**Cost:** MB 1, PD 1\
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute\
**Requirements:** None

You create a volume of sound that rises,
recedes, approaches, or remains at a fixed place centred at
a point within range. You choose what type of sound the power
creates when manifesting it and cannot thereafter change its
basic character. The volume of sound created, however, depends
on your psionic threshold. You can produce as much noise as
four normal humans per psionic threshold (maximum of twenty humans).
Thus, talking, singing, shouting, walking, marching, or running
sounds can be created. The noise produced can be virtually
any type of sound within the volume limit. A horde of rats
running and squeaking is about the same volume as eight humans
running and shouting. A roaring lion is equal to the noise
from sixteen humans, while a roaring dire lion is equal to
the noise from twenty humans.

If you wish to create a specific message, up to twenty-five
words can be created, and those words repeat
until the duration expires or the power is dismissed. If you
attempt to exactly duplicate the voice of a specific individual
or an inherently terrifying sound (such as a dragon's roar),
you must succeed on a Deception check
(with underlying ability determined by your psionics ability)
opposed by the listener's
Wisdom (Insight) check to avoid arousing suspicion.

Create sound can be used to bring sounds into existence that
you later manipulate by manifesting \power{control sound}.
