**Requirements:** Mundane matter

You touch any mundane matter in front of
you, morphing it into a weapon of your choosing from the weapons
table (phb 146). The weapon is made of ordinary materials
as appropriate for its kind. If you choose a projectile weapon,
it comes with 3d6 pieces of ammunition of the applicable type.
If you relinquish your grip on the weapon you called for 2
or more consecutive rounds, it loses its coherence and returns
to the substance(s) it originated as.
