# Crisis of Breath
*3rd-level Voice*\
**Manifesting Time:** 1 action\
**Range:** 120 feet\
**Cost:** MB 4, PD 5\
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute\
**Requirements:** Speech, Sight

Your Voice compels a humanoid creature you
can see in range
and that can hear and understand you
to purge its entire store of air in one explosive
exhalation, thereby disrupting its autonomic breathing
cycle. The target's lungs do not automatically function again
while the powers's duration lasts.

If the target succeeds on a Wisdom save when crisis of breath
is manifested, it is unaffected by this power. If it fails
its Wisdom save, it can still continue to breathe by taking
a standard action in each round to gasp for breath.

An affected creature can attempt to take actions normally
(instead of consciously controlling its breathing), but each
round it does so, beginning in the round when it failed its
Wisdom save, the target risks blacking out from lack of oxygen.
It must succeed on a Constitution save at the end of any of
its turns in which it did not consciously take a breath. The
DC of this save increases by 1 in every consecutive round
after the first one that goes by without a breath; the DC
drops back to its original value if the target spends an action
to take a breath.

If a target fails its Constitution save, it becomes unconscious.
At the end of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points but
must take death saving throws. Curing powers or spells can
revive a dying subject normally, so long as this power's
duration has expired.
If the power is still in effect, a revived
creature still must take Constitution saves in each round
when it does not consciously breathe.
