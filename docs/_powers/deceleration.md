# Deceleration
*1st-level Spacefolding*\
**Manifesting Time:** 1 action\
**Range:** 60 feet\
**Cost:** MB 1, PD 1\
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute\
**Requirements:** Sight

You warp space around a creature in range
that you can see, hindering the target's ability to move.
The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, otherwise
their speed (in every movement mode they possess) is halved.

A subsequent manifestation of deceleration on the target does
not further decrease its speed.
