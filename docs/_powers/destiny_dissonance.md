# Destiny Dissonance
*1st-level Prescience*\
**Manifesting Time:** 1 action\
**Range:** Touch\
**Cost:** MB 1, PD 1\
**Duration:** 1 round per psionic threshold\
**Requirements:** None

Your mere touch grants a creature a vision
of the limitless potential of the not-yet-determined future,
possibilities undulating like a cloth blowing in the wind.
Unaccustomed to such a revelation, the creature's mind is
overwhelmed. Make a melee psionics attack against a creature.
If the attack hits, the creature takes 1d10 psychic damage
and becomes poisoned for a number of rounds equal to your
psionic threshold (concluding at the end of their turn
in the final round).
