# Detect Hostile Intent
*2nd-level Voice*\
**Manifesting Time:** 1 action\
**Range:** 30 feet\
**Cost:** MB 2, PD 3\
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes\
**Requirements:** None

While the duration of this power lasts, you
become aware of the presence of any creatures with hostile
intent within 30 feet of you, and their direction from you
(but not their specific location). The power detects active
aggression, as opposed to vigilance. In addition, while this
power is active you cannot be surprised by creatures that
are susceptible to this mind-affecting power.

While under the effect of this power, you can make Wisdom
(Insight) checks as a free action against anyone you can see
within 30 feet of you.

The power can penetrate barriers, but 3 feet of stone, 3 inches
of common metal, 1 inch of lead, or 6 feet of wood or dirt
blocks it.
