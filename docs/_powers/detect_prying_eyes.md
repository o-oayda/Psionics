You immediately become aware of any attempt
to observe you by means of a Prescience power or Divination
spell. The power's effect radiates in a 40-foot radius from
you and moves as you move. You know the location of every
psionic or magical sensor within the power's area.

If the viewing attempt originates within the area, you also
know the viewer's location. Otherwise, you and the remote
viewer immediately make opposed checks. You make an ability
check using your psionics ability modifier, and the remote
viewer makes a check using their modifier for manifesting
powers or casting spells if a power or spell respectively
gave rise to the remote viewing. If you at least match the
remote viewer's result, you get a visual image of the remote
viewer and a roughly accurate sense of the remote viewer's
direction and distance from you.
If the viewer is on a different plane of existence,
you merely learn which plane the remote viewing attempt is
originating from.
