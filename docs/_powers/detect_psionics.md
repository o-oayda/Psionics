For the power's duration, you sense the
presence of psionics within 30 feet of you. If you sense psionics
in this way, you can use your action to see a faint aura around
any visible creature or object in the area that bears psionic
effects, and you learn the discipline of the effect, if any.

The power can penetrate most barriers, but is blocked by 1
foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead,
or 3 feet of wood or dirt.
