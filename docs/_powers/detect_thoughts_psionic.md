Your inner Voice peers into the minds of others,
gleaning information otherwise concealed to you.
When you manifest this power,
and as an action on each turn until the power end,
you can focus on any one creature you can see within 30 feet of you.
If the creature has an Intelligence of 3 or lower,
they are unaffected.

While focusing on a creature,
if the creature has an Intelligence of 14 or higher,
the sensation of a presence within their mind grows on them.
Nonetheless,
you learn the surface level thoughts of that creature.
`Surface level thoughts' includes what is most
immediately on the creature's mind,
however does not include information a creature is attempting to conceal
unless they are careless or recklessly indifferent
towards revealing that information.

As an action,
you can probe deeper into the creature's mind,
in which case the creature must make a Wisdom saving throw.
If they fail,
you gain insight into one of its more inner desires,
including something that looms large in its mind.
You may then use another action to glean another piece of information
from the creature, prompting a further save.
If they succeed the original save, the power ends.
Regardless,
the creature knows that you are probing into its mind
and can use an action on its turn to make an Intelligence check
contested by a check using your psionics ability modifier.
If the creature succeeds on the contest,
the power ends.

You can also use this power to detect the presence of thinking creatures
you can't see.
When you manifest the power or as your action during the duration,
you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you.
The power can penetrate barriers,
but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead,
or a thin sheet of lead blocks you.
You can't detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower.
Once you detect the presence of a creature in this way,
you can read its thoughts for the rest of the duration as described above,
even if you can't see it, but it must still be within range.
