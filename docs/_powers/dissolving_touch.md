Your touch, claw, or bite is corrosive, and
sizzling moisture visibly oozes from your natural weapon or
hand. You deal 4d6 acid damage to any creature or object you
hit with your next melee attack using the coated natural weapon
or unarmed attack. You are immune to your own acid. If you
do not land a hit within a minute of manifesting this power,
the effect wears off.
