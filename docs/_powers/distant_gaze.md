You can see and hear a distant location almost
as if you were there. You don't need to see the location,
but the locale must be known; that is, it must be a place
familiar to you or an obvious one proximate to you, such as
behind a nearby door, around a nearby corner, or in a grove
of nearby trees.
The location cannot be more than one mile from you.
Once you have selected the locale, the focus
of your clairvoyant sense doesn't move, but you can rotate
it in all directions to view the area as desired. Unlike other
scrying powers, this power does not allow psionically
or supernaturally enhanced senses to work through it.

If the chosen locale is magically or psionically dark, you
see nothing. If it is naturally pitch black, you can see in
a 10-foot radius around the center of the power's effect.
The power does not work across planes.
