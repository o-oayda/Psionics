# Divert Teleport
*7th-level Spacefolding*\
**Manifesting Time:** 1 reaction, when you take whenever another creature teleports\
**Range:** 120 feet\
**Cost:** MB 6, PD 13\
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes\
**Requirements:** Sight

You can bend space and time to divert the
final destination of any teleportation attempt made by any
creature within 120 feet of you that you can see.
This power is manifested as a reaction to that attempt.

You can divert the destination of both incoming and outgoing
teleportations, psionic and magical. Whenever you use this
power, the teleporting creature makes a Wisdom saving throw.
If they succeed, the diversion is foiled.

For the purpose of this power, `divert' means you choose
the actual destination of any teleportation attempt you can
affect, as if you yourself were teleporting to that location,
regardless of the teleportation range of the effect you are
diverting. The destination you choose must be a location with
which you are very familiar by experience or that you have
studied carefully.
