# Drain Power
*4th-level Voice*\
**Manifesting Time:** 1 action\
**Range:** 30 feet\
**Cost:** MB 4, PD 7\
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute\
**Requirements:** Speech, Sight

Your Voice commands a target to relinquish
their psionic power reserves to you. Choose a target that
you can see within range
and that can hear and understand you.
The target must succeed on a Wisdom
saving throw or immediately lose 1d6 psi dice, one of which
is added to your pool of psi dice. If the target has innate
talents, you may instead nominate to expend one use of any
of their innate talents which,
if manifested as a power,
would have a psi dice cost of up to 6.

The target continues to lose 1d6 psi dice each round you maintain
concentration on the power and the subject remains in range
(or, alternatively, continues to expend uses of innate talents
that you choose). In addition, you must continually use your
action on your turn to use the power. If the subject is left
with 0 psi dice or has totally expended their uses of innate
talents, the power ends.
