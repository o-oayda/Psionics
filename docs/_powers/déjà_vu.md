# Déjà Vu
*1st-level Voice*\
**Manifesting Time:** 1 action\
**Range:** 60 feet\
**Cost:** MB 1, PD 1\
**Duration:** 1 round\
**Requirements:** Speech, Sight

The power of your Voice commands a target
in range that you can see to repeat their previous decisions.
The target must be able to hear and understand you.
The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be forced
to repeat the actions they took on their previous turn. If
the situation has changed in such a way that the target can't
take the same actions again (if its foe is dead, or the target
has run out of psi dice, and so on), the target stands still
and takes no actions for 1 round. In any event, the target
can still defend itself.
