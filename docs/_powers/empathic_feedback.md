Your Voice berates your attacker, causing
it to empathically share your pain and suffering. Each time
a creature that can hear and understand you hits you,
it takes damage equal to the amount it
dealt to you or 5 points, whichever is less. This damage is
empathic in nature, so powers and abilities the attacker may
have such as damage reduction and regeneration do not lessen
or change this damage. The damage from empathic feedback has
no type, so even if you took fire damage from a creature that
has immunity to fire, empathic feedback will damage your attacker.
