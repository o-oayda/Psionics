# Energy Bolt
*3rd-level Psychokinesis*\
**Manifesting Time:** 1 action\
**Range:** Self (120-foot line)\
**Cost:** MB 3, PD 5\
**Duration:** Instantaneous\
**Requirements:** None

Upon manifesting this power, you choose cold,
lightning, fire, or thunder. You release a powerful stroke
of energy of the chosen type that emanates from your finger
tips, forming a line 120 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature
in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature
takes 6d6 points of damage of the chosen type on a failed
save, or half as much on a successful save.

\subparagraph{Cold} A bolt of this energy type deals +1 point
of damage per die. The saving throw to reduce damage from
a cold bolt is a Constitution save instead of a Dexterity
save.

\subparagraph{Lightning} Manifesting a bolt of this energy
type provides a +2 bonus to the save DC if the target is wearing
metal armour.

\subparagraph{Fire} A bolt of this energy type deals +1 point
of damage per die.

\paragraph{Thunder} A bolt of this energy type deals -1 point
of damage per die but provides a +1 bonus to the save DC.
