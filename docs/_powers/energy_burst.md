# Energy Burst
*3rd-level Psychokinesis*\
**Manifesting Time:** 1 action\
**Range:** Self (30-foot sphere)\
**Cost:** MB 3, PD 5\
**Duration:** Instantaneous\
**Requirements:** None

Upon manifesting this power, you choose cold,
lightning, fire, or thunder. You create an explosion of unstable
energy of the chosen type that radiates over a 30-foot sphere
centred on yourself. Every creature or object within range
that fails a Dexterity saving throw takes 6d6 damage of the
chosen type, or half as much damage on a successful save.
The explosion creates almost no pressure. Since this power
extends outward from you, you are not affected by the damage.

\subparagraph{Cold} A burst of this energy type deals +1 point
of damage per die. The saving throw to reduce damage from
a cold burst is a Constitution save instead of a Dexterity
save.

\subparagraph{Lightning} Manifesting a burst of this energy
type provides a +2 bonus to the save DC to creatures wearing
metal armour.

\subparagraph{Fire} A burst of this energy type deals +1 point
of damage per die.

\subparagraph{Thunder} A burst of this energy type deals -1
point of damage per die but provides a +1 bonus to the save
DC.
