# Energy Push
*2nd-level Psychokinesis*\
**Manifesting Time:** 1 action\
**Range:** 60 feet\
**Cost:** MB 2, PD 3\
**Duration:** Instantaneous\
**Requirements:** Sight, Line of Effect

Upon manifesting this power, you choose cold,
lightning, fire, or thunder. You project a solid blast of
energy of the chosen type at a target in range that you
can see and have line of effect to. The target must make
a Dexterity saving throw, suffering from 4d6 points of damage
of the chosen type if they fail.

In addition, if the target is
up to one size category larger than you and fails a Strength
saving throw, the driving force of the energy blast pushes
it back 5 feet plus another 5 feet for every 5 points of
damage it takes.

If a wall or other solid object prevents
the subject from being pushed back, the subject instead
slams into the object and takes an extra 2d6 points of damage
from the impact (no save).

\subparagraph{Cold}
A blast of this energy type
deals +1 point of damage per die.
This does not apply to the slam damage.
The saving throw to reduce damage from a cold push
is a Constitution save instead of a Dexterity save.

\subparagraph{Lightning}
Manifesting a blast of this energy type provides a +2 bonus
to the save DC if the target is wearing metal armour.

\subparagraph{Fire}
A blast of this energy type deals +1
point of damage per die (damage from impact remains at
2d6 points).

\subparagraph{Thunder}
A blast of this energy
type deals -1 point of damage per die
(damage from impact
remains at 2d6 points)
but provides a +1 bonus to the save DC.
