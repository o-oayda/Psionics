# Energy Transformation
*7th-level Prana Bindu*\
**Manifesting Time:** 1 action\
**Range:** Self (30-foot line), see text\
**Cost:** MB 5, PD 13\
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes\
**Requirements:** None

Your bodily assimilates some of the effects
of an energy attack and converts it into a jet of plasma.
When you manifest this power, the total amount of cold, fire,
lightning or thunder damage that you take from separate sources
is reduced by 10, to a minimum of 0. The amount of damage
that has been reduced is `absorbed'. You also have advantage
on saving throws to maintain concentration on powers if the
saving throw was prompted by damage of the aforementioned
types. \emph{Note:} if a separate source of damage is absorbed
and reduced to zero damage,
you do not need to make a Constitution saving throw
to maintain concentration on any powers.

Whenever you absorb damage, you store up the energy and can
later discharge it as a jet of plasma. To discharge a ray
requires a standard action. The ray emerges from you as a
30-foot line with a width of 5 feet. Each creature caught
in the path of the ray takes damage equal to the amount of
energy damage you have stored on a failed save, or half as
much on a successful save. However, the total damage is capped
at five times your psionic threshold. The ray you fire
does fire or lightning damage (you may decide on the type).

You can choose to fire any number of rays during the power's
duration. As long as this power remains in effect, you can
continue to absorb energy damage and fire additional rays
using the stored damage.
