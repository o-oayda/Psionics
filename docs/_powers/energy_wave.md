Upon manifesting this power,
you choose cold, lightning, fire, or thunder.
You create a flood of energy of the chosen type
that deals 13d6 points of damage
to each creature and object in a 60-foot cone
centred on yourself that fails a Dexterity saving throw,
or half as much on a successful save.
This power originates at your hand
and extends outward in a 60-foot cone.

\subparagraph{Cold}
A wave of this energy type deals +1 point
of damage per die.
The saving throw to reduce damage from a cold wave
is a Constitution save instead of a Dexterity save.  

\subparagraph{Lightning}
Manifesting a wave of this energy type
provides a +2 bonus to the save DC if the target is wearing
metal armour.

\subparagraph{Fire}
A wave of this energy type deals +1 point of damage per die.

\subparagraph{Thunder}
A wave of this energy type deals -1 point of damage per die
but grants a +1 bonus to the save DC.
