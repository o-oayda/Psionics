# Envenom
*1st-level Prana Bindu*\
**Manifesting Time:** 1 bonus action\
**Range:** Touch\
**Cost:** MB 1, PD 1\
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute\
**Requirements:** None

Your saliva briefly turns into a caustic
bile which does no damage to you, but can damage your enemies.
You may use your bonus action to coat one weapon you are holding
with the bile. The next time you hit with that weapon, the
bile deals 2d4 acid damage.

After the hit, roll 1d10. On a roll of 10, the bile totally
corrodes the weapon you coated, and it is destroyed (unless
it is a magic weapon, resistant to acid damage or otherwise
impervious to physical damage).
