Your vice-like grip burns those that oppose
you. As part of the power's manifesting time, take the grapple
action against a creature within melee range. If the grapple
is successful, the target immediately takes 2d6 fire damage.
On every turn you start while the target is still grappled,
the target takes an additional 2d6 fire damage. Whenever the
grapple ends, the target must succeed on a Strength saving
throw or fall prone.
