# Fusion
*8th-level Prana Bindu*\
**Manifesting Time:** 1 action\
**Range:** Touch\
**Cost:** MB 8, PD 15\
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute\
**Requirements:** None

You and another willing, corporeal, living
creature of the same or smaller size fuse into one being.
As the manifester, you control the actions of the fused being.
However, you can give up this control to the other creature.
Once you give up control, you cannot regain it unless the
other creature relinquishes it.

The fused being has your current hit points plus the other
creature's current hit points. The fused being knows all
the powers you and the other creature know, has the sum of
your and the other creature's psi dice, has the sum of your
and the other creature's spell slots, and knows or has prepared
any spells you or the other creature possesses (if any). Likewise,
all feats, racial abilities, and class features are pooled
(if both creatures have the same ability, the fused being
gains it only once). For each of the six ability scores, the
fused being's score is the higher of yours and the other
creature's, and the fused being also has the higher hit dice
and psionic threshold; this effectively means the fused being
uses the better saving throws, attack bonus, and skill modifiers
of either member, and it manifests powers up to the higher
of the psionic thresholds that you or the other creature possessed
before becoming fused.

You decide what equipment is absorbed into the fused being
and what equipment remains available for use. These fused
items are restored once the power ends.

When the power ends, the fused being separates. The other
creature appears in an area adjacent to you that you determine.
If separation occurs in a cramped space, the other creature
is expelled through the Astral Plane, finally coming to rest
materially in the nearest empty space and taking 1d6 force
damage for each 10 feet of solid material passed through.

Damage taken by the fused being is split evenly between you
and the other creature when the power ends. You do not leave
the fusion with more hit points than you entered it with,
unless you were damaged prior to the fusion and the fused
being was subsequently healed. In a like manner, the fused
being's remaining psi dice are split between you and
the other creature (you can leave with more psi dice than you
entered with, as long as you don't exceed the maximum psi dice
for your level and ability score).

If a fused being is killed, it separates into its constituent
creatures, both of which are also dead.
