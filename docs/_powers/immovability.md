# Immovability
*4th-level Prana Bindu*\
**Manifesting Time:** 1 action\
**Range:** Self\
**Cost:** MB 4, PD 7\
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour\
**Requirements:** None

You are almost impossible to move.
Your weight does not vary;
instead, your body adjusts itself to withstand immense amounts
of force. You could conceivably do this in mid-air. You have
a +10 bonus on any check or saving throw against being moved.
You can't voluntarily move to a new location unless you stop
concentrating, which ends the power.

While under the effects of this power, you cannot add your
Dexterity bonus to your AC; however, your anchored body gains
damage threshold (10).

You cannot make physical attacks or perform any other large-scale
movements (you can make small-scale movements, such as breathing,
turning your head, moving your eyes, talking, and so on).
