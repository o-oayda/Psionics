Your body prepares itself to undertake an
incredible feat of agility and strength. As a bonus action,
you can propel yourself across vast distances. You gain a
flying speed equal to your base movement speed until the end
your current turn. For example, if you have taken the dash
action on your turn to double your base movement speed, the
fly speed you gain would be equal to that doubled speed.
