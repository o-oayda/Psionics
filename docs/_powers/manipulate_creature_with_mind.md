# Manipulate Creature With Mind
*4th-level Psychokinesis*\
**Manifesting Time:** 1 action\
**Range:** 60 feet\
**Cost:** MB 3, PD 7\
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute\
**Requirements:** Sight

You deal psychokinetic blows at a distance
against creatures you can see. For the power's duration,
you can perform the shove, disarm or grapple action without
needing to be in melee range (however, the target needs to
be within the power's range).
Resolve these attempts as normal. Wherever you
would make a Strength (Athletics) check or attack roll, use
your psionics attack modifier for the roll.
