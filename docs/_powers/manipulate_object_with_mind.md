# Manipulate Object With Mind
*3rd-level Psychokinesis*\
**Manifesting Time:** 1 action\
**Range:** 120 feet\
**Cost:** MB 2, PD 5\
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute\
**Requirements:** Sight

By focusing your mind, you are able to manipulate
objects as you desire. Choose an object you can see within
range weighing no more than 250 pounds. Each turn you spend
concentrating on this power, including the turn in which you
manifest this power, you may move the object up to 20 feet.
This power ends if the object is moved out of range or you
can no longer see the object, and if you cease concentration,
the object falls or stops.

You may drop the object and pick up another during the same
turn as long as you don't stop concentrating on the power.
You may also exert fine control on the objects you move. The
object does not move fast enough to cause any damage when
being rammed into other creatures or objects, however it can
cause damage to creatures and objects if it is dropped onto
them. In this case,
the object or creature deals as much bludgeoning
damage as it would take from the fall itself. If the object
falls onto a creature, they must make a Dexterity saving throw,
taking the full damage on a failed save and no damage on a
successful save.

If the object you are attempting to move is being carried,
worn or is equipped to a creature in some way, the creature
can prevent you from moving the object. If they do so, make
an ability check with your psionics ability modifier (not
psionics attack modifier) contested by their Strength check.
If they win the contest, you cannot move that and any other
object until your turn ends. If the contest ends in a draw,
you cannot move that object, but you may attempt to move others.
