**Requirements:** None

As a reaction to when you or an ally within
20 feet of you is targeted by an attack or subject to a harmful
psionic effect, you encase yourself and your allies in a shimmering
palace of psychokinetic force. The palace is a sphere of radius
20 feet centred on you. All damage from powers and innate
talents taken by subjects inside the area of the mind palace
is halved. This lowering takes place prior to the effects
of other powers or abilities that lessen damage. The palace
lasts until the start of your next turn. $^*$Not to be confused
with the \emph{mind palace} ability.
