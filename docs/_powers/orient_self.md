You generally know where you are. This power
is useful to characters who end up at unfamiliar destinations
after teleporting, using a gate, or travelling to or from
other planes of existence. The power reveals general information
about your location as a feeling or presentiment. The information
is usually no more detailed than a summary that locates you
according to a prominent local or regional site. Using this
power also tells you what direction you are facing.
