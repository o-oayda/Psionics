**Manifesting Time:** 1 action\
**Range:** Touch\
**Cost:** MB 4, PD 9\
**Duration:** Instantaneous\
**Requirements:** None

Your mind warps space and time, allowing
you to move yourself or some other creature to another plane
of existence or alternate dimension. If several willing persons
link hands in a circle, as many as eight can be affected by
the plane shift at the same time. Unlike the \spell{plane
shift} spell, precise accuracy as to a particular arrival
location on the intended plane is nigh impossible, unless
you are attuned to a planar beacon or have some other means
of anchoring yourself in one plane. Without these items, when
you travel to another plane of existence, you appear 5 to
500 miles (5d100) from your intended destination.
