You take a hand in influencing the probable
outcomes of your immediate environment. You see the many alternative
branches that reality could take in the next few seconds,
and with this foreknowledge you gain the ability to, while
this power lasts, reroll one attack roll, one saving throw,
one ability check, or one skill check each round. You must
take the result of the reroll, even if it's worse than the
original roll. You do not have to make another roll if satisfied
with your original roll. The roll must be made by yourself.
