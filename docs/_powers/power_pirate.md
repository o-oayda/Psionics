# Power Pirate
*6th-level Voice*\
**Manifesting Time:** 1 action\
**Range:** 60 feet\
**Cost:** MB 5, PD 11\
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 round per psionic threshold\
**Requirements:** Sight

You use your Voice to take over control of a power
requiring concentration that was manifested
by a creature you can see in range.
The target of this power is the manifesting creature.

Once you wrest control of the power from the target,
you have several options.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Allow the power to function as normal.
  \item Keep the power targeted on the manifesting creature
        (if a power with a target of self) but decide how
        the power fulfils its function each round.
  \item Retarget the power on yourself
        (if a power with a target of self).
  \item Choose not to concentrate on the usurped power
          in the next round, ending the power at that point.
\end{itemize}
When the duration of \power{power pirate} expires,
the power you took control of ends
(even if this would mean that the power ends earlier than normal).
