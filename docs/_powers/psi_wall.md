# Psi Wall
*4th-level Metacreativity*\
**Manifesting Time:** 1 action\
**Range:** 30 feet\
**Cost:** MB 4, PD 7\
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute\
**Requirements:** Sight, Mundane matter

You fashion a great wall of raw material
which erupts from the earth at a point you can see within
range. The wall cannot move once it is formed. The origin
of the wall must be within range, but it can extend past this
power's range. It is 1 inch thick per psionic threshold and
has a side length of 10 feet per psionic threshold. You can
also choose to form the wall into a sphere or hemisphere with
a radius of up to 1 foot per psionic threshold. The wall must
be continuous and unbroken when manifested. If its surface
is interrupted by any object or creature, the power fails.

Each 10-foot panel of the wall (or section of surface area
100 ft.$^2$) has 10 hit points per inch of thickness and damage
immunity (5). A section of the wall whose hit points drop
to 0 is breached and can be passed through. Otherwise, if
a creature tries to break through the wall, they can do so
with a successful Strength check with DC equal to 15 + the
number of inches it is thick.

The wall is susceptible to the \power{dispel psionics} power,
but it gains a +4 bonus on any check to determine whether
the wall is negated in such a way. Spells and breath weapons
cannot pass through the wall in either direction, since the
wall provides total cover (though they could damage it). Powers
which ordinarily do not require line of effect cannot target
creatures or objects on the opposite side of the wall. However,
the wall does not block travel by Spacefolding. The wall is
opaque, and thus a creature on one side does not have sight
of creatures or objects on the other side.
