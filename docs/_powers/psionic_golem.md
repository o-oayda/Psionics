# Psionic Golem
*1st-level Metacreativity*\
**Manifesting Time:** 1 action\
**Range:** 30 feet\
**Cost:** MB 1, PD 1\
**Duration:** Up to 1 minute\
**Requirements:** Mundane matter

\textit{Note: you cannot manifest this power
unless you have learnt the create golem Metacreativity tenet.}

This power creates one 1st-level psionic golem
(see \secref{sec:psionic_golem})
that attacks your enemies. It appears where you designate
in range and acts whenever you end your turn (it still technically
acts on your turn, however). It attacks your opponents to
the best of its ability. As a free action, you can mentally
direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or
to perform other actions. The psionic golem acts normally
on the last round of the power's duration and dissipates
after you finish your turn.
