You gain historical vision in a given location.
Rooms, streets, tunnels, and other discrete locations accumulate
psychic impressions left by powerful emotions experienced
in a given area. These impressions offer you a picture of
the location's past.

The types of events most likely to leave psychic impressions
are those that elicited strong emotions: battles and betrayals,
marriages and murders, births and great pain, or any other
event where one emotion dominates. Everyday occurrences leave
no residue for a manifester to detect.

The vision of the event is dreamlike and shadowy. You do not
gain special knowledge of those involved in the vision, though
you might be able to read large banners or other writing if
they are in your language.

Beginning with the most recent significant event at a location
and working backward in time, you can sense one distinct event
for every 10 minutes you maintain concentration, if any such
events exist to be sensed. Your sensitivity extends into the
past a maximum number of years equal to 200 times your psionic
threshold.
