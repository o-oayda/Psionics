You can readjust your body to boost one physical
ability score at the expense of one or more of the other scores.
Select one ability score you would like to boost, and increase
it by the same amount that you decrease one or more other
scores.

You can boost your Strength, Dexterity or Constitution score
by an amount equal to your psionic threshold (or any lesser
amount), assuming you can afford to burn your other ability
scores to such an extent. You may boost your ability scores
past 20 in this fashion.

When the duration of this power expires, your ability boost
ends, but your ability score decrease remains until you
finish a long rest.
