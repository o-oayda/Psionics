# Recall
*1st-level Prescience*\
**Manifesting Time:** 1 minute\

**Requirements:** None

By meditating on a subject, you can recall
natural memories and knowledge otherwise inaccessible to you.

When you fail a History, Religion, Arcana or Nature check,
you can manifest this power to, at the end of the power's
manifesting time, repeat the check. If successful, you instantly
recall what was previously buried in your subconscious.
