# Remote Viewing Trap
*6th-level Prescience*\
**Manifesting Time:** 1 action\
**Range:** Self\
**Cost:** MB 5, PD 11\
**Duration:** 24 hours\
**Requirements:** None

When others use any means of scrying you
from afar, your prepared trap gives them a nasty surprise.
If the scryer fails a Wisdom saving throw when it attempts
to scry you, you are undetected. Moreover, the would-be observer
takes 8d6 lightning damage. If the scryer succeeds its saving
throw, it takes only half as much damage and is able to observe
you normally.

Either way, you are aware of the attempt to view you, but
not of the viewer or the viewer's location.
