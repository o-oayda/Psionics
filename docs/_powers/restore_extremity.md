# Restore Extremity
*5th-level Prana Bindu*\
**Manifesting Time:** 1 action\
**Range:** Touch\
**Cost:** MB 5, PD 9\
**Duration:** Instantaneous\
**Requirements:** None

You restore a severed extremity to a creature
that has lost a digit, hand, arm, leg, or even its head. This
power does not restore life, but it returns a lost extremity
to a living or dead creature if the creature is otherwise
mostly intact. The original extremity need not be present
when this power is manifested; a new extremity is created
by the power. If a head is restored to a body, the original
head (if not already destroyed) loses all spark of identity,
and can be considered as dead tissue.
