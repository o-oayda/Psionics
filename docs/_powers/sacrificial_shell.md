**Duration:** Instantaneous\
**Requirements:** Mundane matter

You instantly weave a protective shell around
you which absorbs damage and then falls of. When you make
a saving throw against an effect which would deal fire, cold,
lightning or thunder damage, you may manifest this power as
a reaction. For this saving throw only, if you fail, you take
only half damage from the effect. If you succeed, you take
no damage.
