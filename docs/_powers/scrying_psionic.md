As the \spell{scrying} spell, except as noted
here. The power works across the planes of existence. In addition,
instead of creating an invisible sensor which appears as a
luminous orb, an ethereal form of yourself appears at the
target's location, scarcely detectable to the naked eye.
You, however, must succeed immediately on a Intelligence (Stealth)
check to avoid detection contested by the target's passive
Wisdom (Perception). You have a +10 bonus to this check.

If you wish, you may speak through your ethereal form, however
your voice is whispery and faint.
