# Sense Link
*1st-level Voice*\
**Manifesting Time:** 1 action\
**Range:** 120 feet\
**Cost:** MB 1, PD 1\
**Duration:** Concentration, to 1 minute\
**Requirements:** Sight

You target one willing creature within sight.
You perceive what the target creature perceives using its
sight, hearing, taste, or smell. Only one sense is linked,
and you cannot switch between senses with the same manifestation.

You make any skill checks involving senses, such as Wisdom
(Perception), as the target, and only within the target's
field of view. You lose your Dexterity bonus to AC while directly
sensing what the target senses if you are perceiving using
the target's sight or hearing.

Once sense link is manifested, the link persists even if the
target moves out of the range of the original manifestation
as is normally the case (but the link does not work across
planes). You do not control the target, nor can you communicate
with it by means of this power.

The strength of the target's linked sense could be enhanced
by other powers or items the target possesses, allowing you
the same enhanced sense. If you are blinded or deafened, or
suffer some other sensory deprivation, the linked creature
functions as an independent sensory organ, and provides you
the benefit of the linked sense from its perspective while
this power's duration lasts.
