You use your Voice to convince a creature
that can hear and understand you
that your wounds are in fact its own. A creature you touch
must make a Wisdom saving throw. If they fail, a link is created
between you and that creature. You take half damage from all
attacks that deal damage to you, and the target takes the
remainder as psychic damage. If your hit point maximum is
reduced by any means, that reduction is not shared with the
target. If you are immune, resistant or have some reduction
to the type of damage dealt to you, this also applies to the
linked creature.

When this power ends, subsequent damage is no longer divided
between the target and you, but damage already shared is not
reassigned.
