Your inner Voice is an illuminating light, revealing
minds which have been hidden from you. This power can negate
the \power{psionic mind blank} power or the \spell{mind blank}
spell, affecting all creatures within 30 feet of you. You
can shatter each creature's mind blank by succeeding on a
contest between your roll of 1d20 + your psionic attack modifier
and each targets' roll of 1d20 + their psionics attack modifier
or their spellcasting attack modifier, depending on whether
a power or spell respectively gave rise to the mind blank
effect. If you succeed, the mind blank ends, allowing
you to affect the target thereafter with Voice or any other
powers and abilities.
