# Skate
*1st-level Spacefolding*\
**Manifesting Time:** 1 action\
**Range:** Self or touch\
**Cost:** MB 1, PD 1\
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute\
**Requirements:** None

You, another willing creature, or an unattended
object can slide along solid ground as if on smooth ice. If
you manifest skate on yourself or another creature, the target
of the power retains equilibrium by mental desire alone, allowing
them to gracefully skate along the ground, turn, or stop suddenly
as desired. The skater's base movement speed increases by
15 feet.

The target can skate up or down any incline or decline they
could normally walk upon without mishap, though skating up
an incline reduces the target's speed to normal, while skating
down a decline increases their speed by an additional 15 feet.

If you manifest skate on an object, treat the object as having
only one-tenth of its normal weight for the purpose of dragging
it along the ground.
