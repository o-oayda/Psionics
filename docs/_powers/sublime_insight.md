# Sublime Insight
*9th-level Prescience*\
**Manifesting Time:** 1 hour\
**Range:** Self\
**Cost:** MB 9, PD 17\
**Duration:** Instantaneous\
**Requirements:** None

You elevate your mind to a
near-universal consciousness,
cogitating countless impressions and predictions
involving any creature you have seen before,
whether personally or by means of another power
such as \nameref{pwr:scrying_psionic}.

This process gives you an uncannily accurate vision
of the creature's nature,
activities,
and whereabouts.
When you manifest the power,
you learn the following facts about the creature.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Its name, race, alignment, and character class.
  \item A general estimate of its level and hit points.
  \item Its location (including place of residence, town,
        state, world, and plane of existence).
  \item Significant items currently in its possession.
  \item Any significant activities or actions the creature
        has undertaken in the previous 8 hours,
        including details such as locales travelled through,
        the names or races of those the creature fought,
        spells it cast,
        items it acquired,
        and items it left behind
        (including the location of those items).
  \item An instantaneous mental view of the creature's
        immediate state.
\end{itemize}

Sublime Insight can defeat spells,
powers,
and special abilities such as \spell{mind blank}
(or even a \spell{wish} spell)
that normally obscures Prescience powers.
You can attempt a Intelligence check against
a DC of 6 + the caster level of the
creator of the obscuring effect)
to defeat these sorts of otherwise impervious defences.

This power is not guaranteed to work against gods, divine beings
and other supremely powerful creatures.
