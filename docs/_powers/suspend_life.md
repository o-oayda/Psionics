# Suspend Life
*6th-level Prana Bindu*\
**Manifesting Time:** 1 action\
**Range:** Self\
**Cost:** MB 5, PD 11\
**Duration:** Permanent unless ended or dismissed, see text\
**Requirements:** None

Your mastery over your body allows you to
slow your metabolism to a point that you are almost in suspended
animation. Even powers that detect life or thought are incapable
of determining that you are alive.

While you are suspended, you are aware of your surroundings.
You feel the passage of one day for every year that actually
passes. Though on a slower schedule, you grow hungry after
a `day' without food (though a year passes in actuality)
and begin to suffer the effects of thirst and starvation as
appropriate.

If you take any damage, you come out of your trance 4 rounds
later. The trance can also be ended by a successful use of
dispel psionics. If you choose to dismiss the power, your
trance ends 1 minute later.
