# Teleport, Psionic
*6th-level Spacefolding*\
**Manifesting Time:** 1 action\
**Range:** 10 feet\
**Cost:** MB 7, PD 11\
**Duration:** Instantaneous\
**Requirements:** Sight

This power allows you to transport yourself to another location
on the same plane of existence as you.
You must transport yourself,
but may also choose up to four other willing creatures (or one object)
that you can see within range.
If you target an object, it must be able to fit entirely inside
a 10-foot cube, and it can't be held or carried by an unwilling creature.

The destination you choose to teleport to must be familiar to you.
The degree of your familiarity with the location impacts
the likelihood that you end up in that location.
The DM rolls a d100 and consults the table below to resolve this.
\begin{table}[htbp]%

\end{table}

\subparagraph{Familiarity}
  `Very familiar' is a place you have been very often,
  a place you have carefully studied,
  or a place you can see when you cast the spell.
  `Seen casually' is somewhere you have seen more than once
  but with which you aren't very familiar.
  `Viewed once' is a place you have seen once,
  possibly using magic or psionics.
  `Description' is a place whose location and appearance you know
  through someone else's description, perhaps from a map.
  `False destination' is a place that doesn't exist.
  Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy's sanctum
  but instead viewed an illusion,
  or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location
  that no longer exists.

\subparagraph{On Target}
  You and your group (or you and the target object)
  appear where you want to.

\subparagraph{Off Target}
  You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away
  from the destination in a random direction.
  Your distance off target is 1d10$\times$1d10 percent of the distance
  that was to be travelled.
  For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles,
  landed off target,
  and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s,
  then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles.
  The DM determines the direction off target randomly
  by rolling a d8 and designating
  1 as north,
  2 as northeast,
  3 as east,
  and so on around the points of the compass.
  If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea,
  you could be in trouble.

\subparagraph{Similar Area}
  You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area
  that's visually or thematically similar to the target area.
  If you are heading for your home monastery,
  you might end up in the lodgings of another psionicist
  or a monk's residence that is visually similar to your monastery.
  Generally, you appear in the closest similar place,
  but since the power has no range limit,
  you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.

\subparagraph{Mishap}
  The power's strain on your mind results in a difficult journey.
  Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 psychic damage,
  and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up
  (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).
