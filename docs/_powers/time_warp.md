# Time Warp
*3rd-level Spacefolding*\
**Manifesting Time:** 1 action\
**Range:** Touch\
**Cost:** MB 3, PD 5\
**Duration:** 1 round per psionic threshold\
**Requirements:** None

A creature of Medium size or smaller you
touch when manifesting this power makes a Wisdom saving throw.
If they fail, they move forward in time for a number of rounds
equal to your psionic threshold. In effect, the target seems
to disappear in a shimmer of silver energy, then reappear
after the duration of this power expires. The target reappears
in exactly the same orientation and condition as before. From
the target's point of view, no time has passed at all.

In each round of the power's duration, on what would have
been the target's turn, it can attempt a Wisdom saving throw.
Success allows the target to return and the power ends. When
the target reappears---whether by succeeding on the save or
the power's duration expiring---the target can act normally
on their next turn.

If the space from which the target departed is occupied upon
their return to the time stream, they appear in the closest
unoccupied space, still in their original orientation. Determine
the closest space randomly if necessary.
