# Tornado
*9th-level Psychokinesis*\
**Manifesting Time:** 1 action\
**Range:** 120 feet\
**Cost:** MB 9, PD 17\
**Duration:** Instantaneous\
**Requirements:** Sight

You induce the formation of a slender vortex
of fiercely swirling air. When you manifest it, a vortex of
air visibly and audibly snakes out from your outstretched
hand, originating at a point you can see in range.
Alternatively,
if you want to aim the vortex at a specific creature you can
see in range, you can make a psionics attack to strike the
creature. If you succeed, direct contact with the vortex deals
8d6 bludgeoning damage to the creature.

Regardless of your choice,
all creatures (including the one possibly damaged
by direct contact) within a cylinder of radius
40 feet and height 100 feet are picked up and violently dashed
about, dealing 17d6 bludgeoning damage to each one. Creatures
that make a successful Dexterity save take half damage.

After being dashed about, each creature that was affected
finds itself situated in a new space 1d4 times 10 feet away
from its original space in a random direction. Walls and other
barriers can restrict this relocation; in such a case, the
creature ends up adjacent to the barrier.
