# Touchsight
*3rd-level Prana Bindu*\
**Manifesting Time:** 1 action\
**Range:** Self\
**Cost:** MB 3, PD 5\
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute\
**Requirements:** None

You generate a subtle telekinetic field of
mental contact, allowing you to `feel' your surroundings
even in total darkness or when your sight would otherwise
be obscured by your physical environment. Your touchsight
field emanates from you out to 60 feet. You ignore invisibility,
darkness, and concealment, though you must have line of sight
to a creature or an object to discern it.

You do not need to make Wisdom (Perception) checks to notice
creatures; you can detect and pinpoint all creatures within
60 feet. In many circumstances, comparing your regular senses
to what you learn with touchsight is enough to tell you the
difference between visible, invisible, hiding, and concealed
creatures.
