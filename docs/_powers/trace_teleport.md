*4th-level Prescience*\
**Manifesting Time:** 1 action\
**Range:** Self (60-foot sphere)\
**Cost:** MB 3, PD 7\
**Duration:** Instantaneous\
**Requirements:** None

You can trace the destination of any psionic or magical
teleportation made by others within a 60-foot radius from
you and that occurred the last minute.

You know the direction and distance the individuals travelled
as if you had casually seen the location. This power does
not grant you any information on the conditions at the other
end of the trace beyond the mental coordinates of the location.
