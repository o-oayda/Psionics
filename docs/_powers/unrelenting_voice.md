**Duration:** Instantaneous\
**Requirements:** Speech$^*$

Your Voice bursts forth from you as tidal
wave of raw force, knocking creatures down. Any creature that
lies within a 30-foot cone centred on yourself must make a
Dexterity or Strength saving throw (their choice), taking
8d4 force damage on a failed saving throw or half as much
on a successful roll. In addition, each target that failed
the save is pushed 10 feet back and knocked prone.
$^*$Creatures need not hear and understand you to be
affected by your Voice.
