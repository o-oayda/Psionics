# Wall Walker
*2nd-level Spacefolding*\
**Manifesting Time:** 1 action\
**Range:** Self\
**Cost:** MB 2, PD 3\
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute\
**Requirements:** None

You reverse the direction of gravity in your
immediate vicinity, allowing you to walk on vertical surfaces
or even traverse ceilings (you need not make any ability checks
to traverse these surfaces). Because of the need to keep at
least one foot in contact with the wall or ceiling at all
times, you cannot jump or take the dash action, and all walls
and ceilings walked on in this way count as difficult terrain.
