# Weapon of Energy
*4th-level Psychokinesis*\
**Manifesting Time:** 1 action\
**Range:** Touch\
**Cost:** MB 4, PD 7\
**Duration:** Until the end of your next turn\
**Requirements:** None

You can manifest this power to energise a
weapon you are holding. The weapon deals an extra 4d8 points
of cold, lightning, fire or thunder damage (as chosen by you
at the time of manifestation) on a successful hit
while the power remains active.

This power can be manifested on a weapon that is magic or
otherwise already deals damage the aforementioned types of
damage, and if the weapon already deals the same type of damage
as the power, the effects stack. If this power is manifested
on a weapon already benefiting from the effect of the power,
the newer manifestation supersedes the older manifestation.
