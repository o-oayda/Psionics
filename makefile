# CUSTOM BUILD RULES

# In case you didn't know, '$@' is a variable holding the name of the target,
# and '$<' is a variable holding the (first) dependency of a rule.
# "raw2tex" and "dat2tex" are just placeholders for whatever custom steps
# you might have.

# %.tex: %.raw
#         ./raw2tex $< > $@

# %.tex: %.dat
#         ./dat2tex $< > $@
