  {1st-level Voice}
  {1 action}
  {30 feet}
  {MB 1, PD 1}
  {Concentration, up to 1 hour}
You plant a compelling attraction in the mind of the target.
The attraction can be toward a particular person or an object.

The target makes a Wisdom saving throw.
If the target fails, they will take reasonable steps to meet,
get close to, attend, or find the object of its implanted attraction.
Otherwise, the power has no effect.

For the purpose of this power, `reasonable' means that, while attracted,
the target doesn't suffer from blind obsession.
They will act on this attraction only when not engaged in combat.
The target won't perform obviously suicidal actions.
They can still recognize danger but will not flee
unless the threat is immediate.

If you make the target feel an attraction to yourself,
you can't command them indiscriminately,
although they will be willing to listen to you (even if they disagree).

This power grants you advantage on any social skill checks
you make involving the target.
\augment{For every 2 additional psi dice you spend,
  this power's save DC increases by 1

If the attack hits, the object explodes.
Any creature within 10 feet of the object must make
a Dexterity saving throw.
If they fail,
they take bludgeoning damage equal to
the damage shown in the table below,
as dependent on the object's size.
If the object was being worn or carried by a creature,
that creature has disadvantage on the saving throw.

  {30 feet}
  {MB 1, PD 1}
  {Concentration, up to 1 minute}
  You create a volume of sound that rises, recedes, approaches,
  or remains at a fixed place centred at a point within range.
  You choose what type of sound the power creates when manifesting it
  and cannot thereafter change its basic character.
  The volume of sound created, however, depends on your psionic threshold.
  You can produce as much noise as four normal humans per psionic threshold
  (maximum twenty humans).
  Thus, talking, singing, shouting, walking,
  marching, or running sounds can be created.
  The noise produced can be virtually any type of sound within the volume limit.
  A horde of rats running and squeaking is about the same volume as eight humans
  running and shouting.
  A roaring lion is equal to the noise from sixteen humans,
  while a roaring dire lion is equal to the noise from twenty humans.

  If you wish to create a specific message,
  up to twenty-five words can be created,
  and those words repeat over and over until the duration expires
  or the power is dismissed.
  If you attempt to exactly duplicate the voice of a specific individual
  or an inherently terrifying sound
  (such as a dragon's roar),
  you must succeed on a Deception check opposed
  by the listener's Wisdom (Insight) check to avoid arousing suspicion.
  
  Create sound can be used to bring sounds into existence that you later
  manipulate by manifesting control sound.
