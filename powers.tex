  {Attraction}
  {1st-level Voice}
  {1 action}
  {30 feet}
  {MB 1, PD 1}
  {Concentration, up to 1 hour}
You plant a compelling attraction in the mind of the target.
The attraction can be toward a particular person or an object.

The target makes a Wisdom saving throw.
If the target fails, they will take reasonable steps to meet,
get close to, attend, or find the object of its implanted attraction.
Otherwise, the power has no effect.

For the purpose of this power, `reasonable' means that, while attracted,
the target doesn't suffer from blind obsession.
They will act on this attraction only when not engaged in combat.
The target won't perform obviously suicidal actions.
They can still recognize danger but will not flee
unless the threat is immediate.

If you make the target feel an attraction to yourself,
you can't command them indiscriminately,
although they will be willing to listen to you (even if they disagree).

This power grants you advantage on any social skill checks
you make involving the target.
\augment{For every 2 additional psi dice you spend,
  this power's save DC increases by 1
  and the bonus on social skill checks increases by 1.}

  {Blow Up Object With Mind}
  {1st-level Psychokinesis}
  {1 action}

  {MB 1, PD 1}
  {Instantaneous}
Your terrifying mental ability can cause matter to
wrench itself apart. 
Choose an object within range.
The object can be carried or worn by a creature.
Make a psionics attack roll against the object.
The AC is determined by the size of object, shown below.

If the attack hits, the object explodes.
Any creature within 10 feet of the object must make
a Dexterity saving throw.
If they fail,
they take bludgeoning damage equal to
the damage shown in the table below,
as dependent on the object's size.
If the object was being worn or carried by a creature,
that creature has disadvantage on the saving throw.
\augment{For every 2 additional psi dice you spend,

  {Concentration, up to 10 minutes}
You can adjust your body's equilibrium to correspond
with any solid or liquid that you stand on.
Thus, you can walk on water, quicksand,
or even a spider's web without sinking or breaking through
(this effect does not confer any resistance to particularly sticky webs).
You can move at your normal speed,
but you cannot take the Dash action
on an non-firm surface without sinking or breaking through.

If you fall from any height while using this power,
damage from the impact is halved.

  {Cloud Mind}
  {2nd-level Voice}
  {1 action}
  {30 feet}
  {MB 2, PD 3}
  {Concentration, up to 1 minute}
You make yourself completely undetectable to a target in range
by erasing all awareness of your presence from its mind.
If the target fails a Wisdom saving throw,
this power has the following effects.

First, you are invisible and inaudible to the creature.
It cannot even detect your presence by means of blindsight,
scent, or tremorsense.
It cannot pinpoint your location by any means.
\textit{Exception:} Creatures with truesight are still
able to discern your location,
and therefore the power has no effect on them.
  
Second, the target remains unaware of your actions,
provided you do not make any attacks or cause any obvious
or directly threatening changes in the target's environment.\
If you attack the target creature, the effect ends.
  
If you take an action that creates a sustained and obvious change
in the target's environment---for example, attacking a creature
aside from the target or moving a large or attended object
the target can see---the target immediately repeats the
saving throw against the power.
An ally of the target creature that is able to see or perceive you
can warn the target and thereby grant it another saving throw.

\DndPowerHeader%
  {Concealing Membrane}
  {2nd-level Metacreativity}
  {1 action}
  {Self}
  {MB 2, PD 3}
  {Concentration, up to 1 minute}
  You weave a quasi-real membrane around yourself,
  which makes you lightly obscured.
  You remain visible within the translucent, amorphous enclosure.
  This distortion also grants you half cover
  thanks to the rippling membrane encasing your form.
  You can pick up or drop objects, easily reaching through the film.
  Anything you hold is enveloped by the membrane.
  Likewise, you can engage in melee, make ranged attacks,
  and manifest powers without hindrance.

\DndPowerHeader%
  {Conceal Thoughts}
  {1st-level Voice}
  {1 action}
  {30 feet}
  {MB 1, PD 1}
  {Concentration, up to 1 hour}
Choose a target within range.
You protect the target's thoughts from analysis.
While the duration lasts, the target gains advantage on
Deception checks against those attempting to discern their
true intentions with Wisdom (Insight).
They also gain advantage on saving throws against any power or spell
used to read their mind (such as detect thoughts).

\DndPowerHeader%
  {Control Sound}
  {2nd-level Psychokinesis}
  {1 action}
  {60 feet}
  {MB 2, PD 3}
  {Concentration, up to 1 minute}
  You shape and alter existing sounds.
  You can target one sound, such as a person speaking or singing,
  or a group of related sounds,
  such as the patter of many raindrops or the tramp of soldiers passing by.
  A sound as quiet as a snapping finger can be controlled.
  You can substitute any sound you have heard for the target sound.
  If you attempt to exactly duplicate the voice of a specific individual,
  or an inherently terrifying sound (such as a dragon's roar),
  you must succeed on a Charisma (Deception) check with advantage
  opposed by the intended listener's Wisdom (Insight) check
  to avoid arousing suspicion.

  You can entirely muffle a noise or magnify a sound to such loudness
  that it drowns out all other conversation in the immediate area.
  
  Alternatively, you can use up the power in an instant.
  You do this by modulating a sound into a one-time destructive impetus
  that shatters nonmagical/nonpsionic,
  unattended objects of crystal, glass, ceramics, or porcelain
  (vials, bottles, flasks, jugs, mirrors, and so forth) in the area.

  {Create Sound}
  {1st-level Metacreativity}
  {1 action}
  {30 feet}
  {MB 1, PD 1}
  {Concentration, up to 1 minute}
  You create a volume of sound that rises, recedes, approaches,
  or remains at a fixed place centred at a point within range.
  You choose what type of sound the power creates when manifesting it
  and cannot thereafter change its basic character.
  The volume of sound created, however, depends on your psionic threshold.
  You can produce as much noise as four normal humans per psionic threshold
  (maximum twenty humans).
  Thus, talking, singing, shouting, walking,
  marching, or running sounds can be created.
  The noise produced can be virtually any type of sound within the volume limit.
  A horde of rats running and squeaking is about the same volume as eight humans
  running and shouting.
  A roaring lion is equal to the noise from sixteen humans,
  while a roaring dire lion is equal to the noise from twenty humans.

  If you wish to create a specific message,
  up to twenty-five words can be created,
  and those words repeat over and over until the duration expires
  or the power is dismissed.
  If you attempt to exactly duplicate the voice of a specific individual
  or an inherently terrifying sound
  (such as a dragon's roar),
  you must succeed on a Deception check opposed
  by the listener's Wisdom (Insight) check to avoid arousing suspicion.
  
  Create sound can be used to bring sounds into existence that you later
  manipulate by manifesting \power{control sound}.

hindering the target's ability to move.
The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw,
otherwise their speed (in every movement mode they possess) is halved.

A subsequent manifestation of deceleration on the subject
does not further decrease its speed.

The power of your Voice commands a target in range
to repeat their previous decisions.
The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw
or be forced to repeat the actions they took on their previous turn.
If the situation has changed in such a way that the target
can't take the same actions again
(if its foe is dead, or the target has run out of psi dice, and so on),
the target stands still and takes no actions for 1 round.
In any event, the target can still defend itself.

  you become aware of the presence of any creatures with hostile intent
  within 30 feet of you,
  and their direction from you
  (but not their specific location).
  The power detects active aggression,
  as opposed to vigilance.
  In addition, while this power is active you cannot be surprised
  by creatures that are susceptible to mind-affecting powers.

  While under the effect of this power,
  you can make Wisdom (Insight) checks as a free action
  against anyone you can see within 30 feet of you.

  fails a Strength saving throw,
  the driving force of the energy blast pushes it back 5 feet
  plus another 5 feet for every 5 points of damage it takes.
  
  If a wall or other solid object prevents the subject from being pushed back,
