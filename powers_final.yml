Adapt Body:
  Name: Adapt Body
  Class: ppk
  Level: '5'
  Discipline: Prana Bindu
  MB: '4'
  PD: '9'
  Manifesting Time: 1 action
  Range: Self
  Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
  Requirements: None
  Short Description: Adapt your body to dangerous environments
  Long Description: |
    Your body automatically adapts to hostile
    environments. You can adapt to underwater, extremely hot,
    extremely cold, or airless environments, allowing you to survive
    as if you were a creature native to that environment. You
    can breathe and move (though penalties to movement and attacks,
    if any for a particular environment, remain), and you take
    no damage simply from being in that environment. You need
    not specify what environment you are adapting to when you
    manifest this power; simply activate it, and your body will
    instantly adapt to any hostile environment as needed throughout
    the duration.

    You can somewhat adapt to extreme environmental features such
    as acid, lava, fire, and lightning. Any environmental feature
    that normally deals damage to you deals
    you only half the usual amount of damage.

    In any case, you have advantage on Constitution saving throws
    to maintain concentration on powers if damage or an otherwise
    hazardous effect from the environment you are adapting to
    prompted the save.

  Manifesting Time: 1 action
  Range: 30 feet
  Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
  Requirements: Speech, Sight
  Short Description: Incept an item of attraction in a creature
  Long Description: |
    Your Voice plants a compelling attraction
    in the mind of a creature you can see and that can hear
    and understand you.
    The attraction can be toward a particular person or an object.

    The target makes a Wisdom saving throw. If the target fails,
    they will take reasonable steps to meet, get close to, attend,
    or find the object of its implanted attraction. Otherwise,
    the power has no effect.

    For the purpose of this power, `reasonable' means that, while
    attracted, the target doesn't suffer from blind obsession.
    They will act on this attraction only when not engaged in
    combat. The target won't perform obviously suicidal actions.
    They can still recognize danger but will not flee unless the
    threat is immediate.

    If you make the target feel an attraction to yourself, you
    can't command them indiscriminately, although they will be
    willing to listen to you (even if they disagree). Accordingly,
    this power grants you advantage on any social skill checks
    you make involving the target.
  Augment: |
    For every 2 additional psi dice you spend, this power's
    save DC increases by 1 and you gain a cumulative +1 bonus

    for one of your attacks. Treat the bite as a melee weapon
    attack. The bite deals 1d8 piercing damage (assuming you are
    a Medium creature) when it hits. Your bite can be affected
    by powers, spells, and effects that enhance or improve weapons.

    If you are not a Medium creature, your bite attack's base
    damage varies as follows: Tiny 1d4; Small 1d6; Large 2d6;
    Huge 2d8; Gargantuan 4d6.

    Based on your psi knight level, your bite increases in ferocity
    as noted here: at 5th level your bite deals an extra 1d8 points
    of damage, at 10th level an extra 2d8, at 15th level an extra
    3d8, and at 20th level an extra 4d8 points.

  Long Description: |
    Your terrifying mental ability can cause

    object within range that you can see.
    The object can be carried or worn by a
    creature. Make a psionics attack roll against the object.
    The AC is determined by the size of object, shown below.
    
    | Size | AC | Damage Die |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Tiny (bottle, pancakes) | 11 | 2d6 |

    | Large (cart, 10x10 ft. window) | 17 | 2d12 |
    
    If the attack hits,
    the object explodes. Any creature within 10 feet of the
    object must make a Dexterity saving throw. If they fail,
    they take bludgeoning damage equal to the damage shown in
    the table below, as dependent on the object's size.
    Otherwise, they take half that amount of damage.
    If the object was being worn or carried by a creature,
    that creature has disadvantage on the saving throw.
  Augment: |
    For every 2 additional psi dice you spend, roll one
    extra die using the same damage die as given for the object's

  Long Description: |
    Your make yourself completely undetectable
    to a target you can see by erasing all awareness of your presence
    from its mind. If the target fails a Wisdom saving throw,
    this power has the following effects.

    First, you are invisible and inaudible to the creature. It
    cannot even detect your presence by means of blindsight, scent,
    or tremorsense. It cannot pinpoint your location by any means.
    *Exception:* Creatures with truesight are still able
    to discern your location, and therefore the power has no effect
    on them.

    Second, the target remains unaware of your actions, provided
    you do not make any attacks or cause any obvious or directly
    threatening changes in the target's environment. If you
    attack the target, the power ends.

    If you take an action that creates a sustained and obvious
    change in the target's environment---for example, attacking
    a creature aside from the target or moving a large or attended
    object the target can see---the target immediately repeats
    the saving throw against the power. An ally of the target
    creature that is able to see or perceive you can warn the
    target and thereby grant it another saving throw.

  Long Description: |
    Your Voice berates and beleaguers the mind of another creature,
    rendering them dazed and confused.
    Choose a creature you can see within range that can
    hear and understand you.
    That creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or
    be affected by this power.

    An affected creature cannot take reactions.
    While the power lasts,
    at the start of each of that creature's turns
    you hone your Voice in such a way
    so as to coarsely influence the actions of the affected creature.
    Roll a d6. If the result is 1--5,
    choose freely from the table below
    to determine the quality of your Voice
    and the associated effect on the creature for that turn.
    The creature cannot do anything on that turn except for
    the relevant effect given above.
    If the result is a 6, the creature is unaffected by your Voice
    and acts normally (but is still affected by the power).

    | Grating       | The target takes 2d10 psychic damage |

    | Discordant    | The target uses all their movement to move in a random direction (determined by the roll of a d8) |
    | Frenetic      | The target makes a single melee attack against a randomly determined creature in their reach, if possible |
    | Pacifying     | The target does nothing |

    At the end of an affected creature's turns,
    they may repeat the Wisdom saving throw,
    ending the power on a success.
  Augment: |
    For every 3 additional psi dice you spend, this power's
    save DC increases by 1, and the power can affect an additional
    target. Any additional target cannot be more than 10 feet

  Short Description: Mould existing sound as you desire
  Long Description: |
    You shape and alter existing sounds. You
    can target one sound, such as a person speaking or singing,
    or a group of related sounds, such as the patter of many raindrops
    or the tramp of soldiers passing by. A sound as quiet as a
    snapping finger can be controlled. You can substitute any
    sound you have heard for the target sound. If you attempt
    to exactly duplicate the voice of a specific individual, or
    an inherently terrifying sound (such as a dragon's roar),
    you must succeed on a Deception check
    (with underlying ability determined by your psionics ability)
    opposed by the intended listener's Wisdom (Insight) check
    to avoid arousing suspicion.

    You can entirely muffle a noise or magnify a sound to such
    loudness that it drowns out all other conversation in the
    immediate area.

    Alternatively, you can use up the power in an instant. You
    do this by modulating a sound into a one-time destructive
    impetus that shatters nonmagical/nonpsionic unattended objects
    of crystal, glass, ceramic, or porcelain make in the area
    (e.g. vials, bottles, flasks, jugs, mirrors, and so forth).

  Requirements: None
  Short Description: Create unique sound
  Long Description: |
    You create a volume of sound that rises,
    recedes, approaches, or remains at a fixed place centred at
    a point within range. You choose what type of sound the power
    creates when manifesting it and cannot thereafter change its
    basic character. The volume of sound created, however, depends
    on your psionic threshold. You can produce as much noise as
    four normal humans per psionic threshold (maximum of twenty humans).
    Thus, talking, singing, shouting, walking, marching, or running
    sounds can be created. The noise produced can be virtually
    any type of sound within the volume limit. A horde of rats
    running and squeaking is about the same volume as eight humans
    running and shouting. A roaring lion is equal to the noise
    from sixteen humans, while a roaring dire lion is equal to
    the noise from twenty humans.

    If you wish to create a specific message, up to twenty-five
    words can be created, and those words repeat
    until the duration expires or the power is dismissed. If you
    attempt to exactly duplicate the voice of a specific individual
    or an inherently terrifying sound (such as a dragon's roar),
    you must succeed on a Deception check
    (with underlying ability determined by your psionics ability)
    opposed by the listener's
    Wisdom (Insight) check to avoid arousing suspicion.

    Create sound can be used to bring sounds into existence that
    you later manipulate by manifesting \power{control sound}.

  Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
  Requirements: None
  Short Description: Detect any nearby creatures that are hostile
    to you
  Long Description: |
    While the duration of this power lasts, you
    become aware of the presence of any creatures with hostile
    intent within 30 feet of you, and their direction from you
    (but not their specific location). The power detects active
    aggression, as opposed to vigilance. In addition, while this
    power is active you cannot be surprised by creatures that
    are susceptible to this mind-affecting power.

    While under the effect of this power, you can make Wisdom
    (Insight) checks as a free action against anyone you can see
    within 30 feet of you.

    The power can penetrate barriers, but 3 feet of stone, 3 inches
    of common metal, 1 inch of lead, or 6 feet of wood or dirt
    blocks it.

    any visible creature or object in the area that bears psionic
    effects, and you learn the discipline of the effect, if any.

  Short Description: Learn who is attempting to scry you
  Long Description: |
    You immediately become aware of any attempt
    to observe you by means of a Prescience power or Divination
    spell. The power's effect radiates in a 40-foot radius from
    you and moves as you move. You know the location of every
    psionic or magical sensor within the power's area.

    If the viewing attempt originates within the area, you also
    know the viewer's location. Otherwise, you and the remote
    viewer immediately make opposed checks. You make an ability
    check using your psionics ability modifier, and the remote
    viewer makes a check using their modifier for manifesting
    powers or casting spells if a power or spell respectively
    gave rise to the remote viewing. If you at least match the
    remote viewer's result, you get a visual image of the remote
    viewer and a roughly accurate sense of the remote viewer's
    direction and distance from you.
    If the viewer is on a different plane of existence,
    you merely learn which plane the remote viewing attempt is
    originating from.

  Long Description: |
    You can bend space and time to divert the
    final destination of any teleportation attempt made by any
    creature within 120 feet of you that you can see.
    This power is manifested as a reaction to that attempt.
    You can divert the destination of both incoming and outgoing
    teleportations whether psionic and magical in nature. Whenever you use this
    power, the teleporting creature makes a Wisdom saving throw.
    If they fail, the teleport is diverted; otherwise, the teleportation
    proceeds as normal.

    This power affects creatures whose teleportation is contingent
    on the target's magic or psionics, for example the willing creature
    optionally brought along by use of the spell \spell{dimension door}.
    That is to say, any number of secondary creatures
    who teleport because of the action of the target are also diverted.  
    
    For the purpose of this power, `divert' means you choose
    the actual destination of any teleportation attempt you can
    affect, as if you yourself were teleporting to that location,
    regardless of the teleportation range of the effect you are
    diverting. The destination you choose must be a location with
    which you are very familiar by experience or that you have
    studied carefully.

    and that can hear and understand you.
    The target must succeed on a Wisdom
    saving throw or immediately lose 1d6 psi dice, one of which
    is added to your pool of psi dice. If the target has innate
    talents, you may instead nominate to expend one use of any
    of their innate talents which,
    if manifested as a power,
    would have a psi dice cost of up to 6.

    The target continues to lose 1d6 psi dice each round you maintain
    concentration on the power and the subject remains in range
    (or, alternatively, continues to expend uses of innate talents
    that you choose). In addition, you must continually use your
    action on your turn to use the power. If the subject is left
    with 0 psi dice or has totally expended their uses of innate
    talents, the power ends.

  Requirements: Speech
  Short Description: Target takes damage when they hit you
  Long Description: |
    Your Voice berates your attacker, causing
    it to empathically share your pain and suffering. Each time
    a creature that can hear and understand you hits you,
    it takes damage equal to the amount it
    dealt to you or 5 points, whichever is less. This damage is
    empathic in nature, so powers and abilities the attacker may
    have such as damage reduction and regeneration do not lessen
    or change this damage. The damage from empathic feedback has
    no type, so even if you took fire damage from a creature that
    has immunity to fire, empathic feedback will damage your attacker.

    metal armour.

    ***Fire.*** A bolt of this energy type deals +1 point

  Long Description: |
    Upon manifesting this power, you choose cold,
    lightning, fire, or thunder. You project a solid blast of
    energy of the chosen type at a target in range that you
    can see and have line of effect to. The target must make
    a Dexterity saving throw, suffering from 4d6 points of damage
    of the chosen type if they fail.
    
    In addition, if the target is
    up to one size category larger than you and fails a Strength
    saving throw, the driving force of the energy blast pushes
    it back 5 feet plus another 5 feet for every 5 points of
    damage it takes.
    
    If a wall or other solid object prevents
    the subject from being pushed back, the subject instead
    slams into the object and takes an extra 2d6 points of damage
    from the impact (no save).
    
    ***Cold.***
    A blast of this energy type
    deals +1 point of damage per die.
    This does not apply to the slam damage.
    The saving throw to reduce damage from a cold push
    is a Constitution save instead of a Dexterity save.
    
    ***Lightning.***
    Manifesting a blast of this energy type provides a +2 bonus
    to the save DC if the target is wearing metal armour.

    Upon manifesting this power, you choose cold,
    lightning, fire, or thunder. You create an explosion of unstable
    energy of the chosen type that radiates over a 30-foot sphere
    centred on yourself. Every creature or object within range
    that fails a Dexterity saving throw takes 6d6 damage of the
    chosen type, or half as much damage on a successful save.
    The explosion creates almost no pressure. Since this power
    extends outward from you, you are not affected by the damage.

    ***Cold.*** A burst of this energy type deals +1 point

    a cold burst is a Constitution save instead of a Dexterity
    save.

    You create a ray of energy of the chosen type that
    shoots forth from your fingertip and strikes a target within range
    that you can see and have line of effect to,
    dealing 2d6 points of damage if you succeed on a
    ranged psionics attack with the ray.
    The type of damage depends on
    the type of energy of the ray you manifest. 
    
    ***Cold.***
      A ray of this energy deals +1 point of cold damage per die.
    
    ***Lightning.***

  Manifesting Time: 1 action
  Range: Self (30-foot line), see text
  Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
  Requirements: None
  Short Description: Convert energy damage into jets of plasma
  Long Description: |
    Your bodily assimilates some of the effects
    of an energy attack and converts it into a jet of plasma.
    When you manifest this power, the total amount of cold, fire,
    lightning or thunder damage that you take from separate sources
    is reduced by 10, to a minimum of 0. The amount of damage
    that has been reduced is `absorbed'. You also have advantage
    on saving throws to maintain concentration on powers if the
    saving throw was prompted by damage of the aforementioned
    types. *Note:* if a separate source of damage is absorbed
    and reduced to zero damage,
    you do not need to make a Constitution saving throw
    to maintain concentration on any powers.

    Whenever you absorb damage, you store up the energy and can
    later discharge it as a jet of plasma. To discharge a ray
    requires a standard action. The ray emerges from you as a
    30-foot line with a width of 5 feet. Each creature caught
    in the path of the ray takes damage equal to the amount of
    energy damage you have stored on a failed save, or half as
    much on a successful save. However, the total damage is capped
    at five times your psionic threshold. The ray you fire
    does fire or lightning damage (you may decide on the type).

    You can choose to fire any number of rays during the power's
    duration. As long as this power remains in effect, you can
    continue to absorb energy damage and fire additional rays
    using the stored damage.

    centred on yourself that fails a Dexterity saving throw,

  Long Description: |
    You deal psychokinetic blows at a distance
    against creatures you can see. For the power's duration,
    you can perform the shove, disarm or grapple action without
    needing to be in melee range (however, the target needs to
    be within the power's range).
    Resolve these attempts as normal. Wherever you
    would make a Strength (Athletics) check or attack roll, use
    your psionics attack modifier for the roll.
  Augment: |
    For every additional psi die you spend, this power

    grapple and disarm.
Manipulate Object With Mind:
  Name: Manipulate Object With Mind
  Class: p
  Level: '3'
  Discipline: Psychokinesis
  MB: '2'
  PD: '5'
  Manifesting Time: 1 action
  Range: 120 feet
  Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
  Requirements: Sight
  Short Description: Move object telekinetically
  Long Description: |
    By focusing your mind, you are able to manipulate
    objects as you desire. Choose an object you can see within
    range weighing no more than 250 pounds. Each turn you spend
    concentrating on this power, including the turn in which you
    manifest this power, you may move the object up to 20 feet.
    This power ends if the object is moved out of range or you
    can no longer see the object, and if you cease concentration,
    the object falls or stops.

    You may drop the object and pick up another during the same
    turn as long as you don't stop concentrating on the power.
    You may also exert fine control on the objects you move. The
    object does not move fast enough to cause any damage when
    being rammed into other creatures or objects, however it can
    cause damage to creatures and objects if it is dropped onto
    them. In this case,
    the object or creature deals as much bludgeoning
    damage as it would take from the fall itself. If the object
    falls onto a creature, they must make a Dexterity saving throw,
    taking the full damage on a failed save and no damage on a
    successful save.

    If the object you are attempting to move is being carried,
    worn or is equipped to a creature in some way, the creature
    can prevent you from moving the object. If they do so, make
    an ability check with your psionics ability modifier (not
    psionics attack modifier) contested by their Strength check.
    If they win the contest, you cannot move that and any other
    object until your turn ends. If the contest ends in a draw,
    you cannot move that object, but you may attempt to move others.
  Augment: |
    For every additional psi die you spend, the weight
    limit of the target increases by 25 pounds.

    talents taken by subjects inside the area of the mind palace
    is halved. This lowering takes place prior to the effects
    of other powers or abilities that lessen damage. The palace
    lasts until the start of your next turn.

    You generally know where you are. This power
    is useful to characters who end up at unfamiliar destinations
    after teleporting, using a gate, or travelling to or from
    other planes of existence. The power reveals general information
    about your location as a feeling or presentiment. The information
    is usually no more detailed than a summary that locates you
    according to a prominent local or regional site. Using this
    power also tells you what direction you are facing.

  Long Description: |
    Your mind warps space and time, allowing
    you to move yourself or some other willing creature to another plane
    of existence or alternate dimension. If several willing persons
    link hands in a circle, as many as eight can be affected by
    the plane shift at the same time. Unlike the \spell{plane
    shift} spell, precise accuracy as to a particular arrival
    location on the intended plane is nigh impossible, unless
    you are attuned to a planar beacon or have some other means
    of anchoring yourself in one plane. Without these items, when
    you travel to another plane of existence, you appear 5 to
    500 miles (5d100) from your intended destination.

    The target of this power is the manifesting creature.

    Once you wrest control of the power from the target,
    you have several options.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Allow the power to function as normal.
      \item Keep the power targeted on the manifesting creature
            (if a power with a target of self) but decide how
            the power fulfils its function each round.
      \item Retarget the power on yourself
            (if a power with a target of self).
      \item Choose not to concentrate on the usurped power
              in the next round, ending the power at that point.
    \end{itemize}
    When the duration of \power{power pirate} expires,
    the power you took control of ends
    (even if this would mean that the power ends earlier than normal).

  Manifesting Time: 1 action
  Range: 30 feet
  Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
  Requirements: Sight, Mundane matter
  Short Description: Create large protective barrier
  Long Description: |
    You fashion a great wall of raw material
    which erupts from the earth at a point you can see within
    range. The wall cannot move once it is formed. The origin
    of the wall must be within range, but it can extend past this
    power's range. It is 1 inch thick per psionic threshold and
    has a side length of 10 feet per psionic threshold. You can
    also choose to form the wall into a sphere or hemisphere with
    a radius of up to 1 foot per psionic threshold. The wall must
    be continuous and unbroken when manifested. If its surface
    is interrupted by any object or creature, the power fails.

    Each 10-foot panel of the wall (or section of surface area
    100 ft.$^2$) has 10 hit points per inch of thickness and damage
    immunity (5). A section of the wall whose hit points drop
    to 0 is breached and can be passed through. Otherwise, if
    a creature tries to break through the wall, they can do so
    with a successful Strength check with DC equal to 15 + the
    number of inches it is thick.

    The wall is susceptible to the \power{dispel psionics} power,
    but it gains a +4 bonus on any check to determine whether
    the wall is negated in such a way. Spells and breath weapons
    cannot pass through the wall in either direction, since the
    wall provides total cover (though they could damage it). Powers
    which ordinarily do not require line of effect cannot target
    creatures or objects on the opposite side of the wall. However,
    the wall does not block travel by Spacefolding. The wall is
    opaque, and thus a creature on one side does not have sight
    of creatures or objects on the other side.

    amount), assuming you can afford to burn your other ability
    scores to such an extent. You may boost your ability scores

Sacrificial Shell:
  Name: Sacrificial Shell

  Manifesting Time: 1 reaction, which you take when making a saving
    throw against certain damage types, see text
  Range: Self
  Duration: Instantaneous
  Requirements: Mundane matter
  Short Description: Gain immediate protection from energy
  Long Description: |
    You instantly weave a protective shell around
    you which absorbs damage and then falls of. When you make
    a saving throw against an effect which would deal fire, cold,
    lightning or thunder damage, you may manifest this power as
    a reaction. For this saving throw only, if you fail, you take
    only half damage from the effect. If you succeed, you take
    no damage.

Sense Link:
  Name: Sense Link
  Class: p
  Level: '1'
  Discipline: Voice
  MB: '1'
  PD: '1'
  Manifesting Time: 1 action
  Range: 120 feet
  Duration: Concentration, to 1 minute
  Requirements: Sight
  Short Description: Perceive through one of the target's senses
  Long Description: |
    You target one willing creature within sight.
    You perceive what the target creature perceives using its
    sight, hearing, taste, or smell. Only one sense is linked,
    and you cannot switch between senses with the same manifestation.

    You make any skill checks involving senses, such as Wisdom
    (Perception), as the target, and only within the target's
    field of view. You lose your Dexterity bonus to AC while directly
    sensing what the target senses if you are perceiving using
    the target's sight or hearing.

    Once sense link is manifested, the link persists even if the
    target moves out of the range of the original manifestation
    as is normally the case (but the link does not work across
    planes). You do not control the target, nor can you communicate
    with it by means of this power.

    The strength of the target's linked sense could be enhanced
    by other powers or items the target possesses, allowing you
    the same enhanced sense. If you are blinded or deafened, or
    suffer some other sensory deprivation, the linked creature
    functions as an independent sensory organ, and provides you
    the benefit of the linked sense from its perspective while
    this power's duration lasts.
  Augment: |
    You can augment this power in one or
    both of the following ways:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item If you spend 2 additional psi dice,
            you can have the target perceive one of your senses
            instead of the other way around.
      \item If you spend 4 additional psi dice,
            you can link to a second sense of the same target.

  Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
  Requirements: Speech
  Short Description: Half of the damage you suffer is carried
    to the target
  Long Description: |
    You use your Voice to convince a creature
    that can hear and understand you
    that your wounds are in fact its own. A creature you touch
    must make a Wisdom saving throw. If they fail, a link is created
    between you and that creature. You take half damage from all
    attacks that deal damage to you, and the target takes the
    remainder as psychic damage. If your hit point maximum is
    reduced by any means, that reduction is not shared with the
    target. If you are immune, resistant or have some reduction
    to the type of damage dealt to you, this also applies to the
    linked creature.

    When this power ends, subsequent damage is no longer divided
    between the target and you, but damage already shared is not
    reassigned.
  Augment: For every 2 additional psi dice you spend, this power's
    save DC increases by 1.

    Your inner Voice is an illuminating light, revealing
    minds which have been hidden from you. This power can negate
    the \power{psionic mind blank} power or the \spell{mind blank}
    spell, affecting all creatures within 30 feet of you. You
    can shatter each creature's mind blank by succeeding on a
    contest between your roll of 1d20 + your psionic attack modifier
    and each targets' roll of 1d20 + their psionics attack modifier
    or their spellcasting attack modifier, depending on whether
    a power or spell respectively gave rise to the mind blank
    effect. If you succeed, the mind blank ends, allowing
    you to affect the target thereafter with Voice or any other
    powers and abilities.

  Short Description: Pummel target behind cover with force damage
  Long Description: |
    A target in range you select is pummelled
    with telekinetic force for 2d6 + 2 force damage as a shockwave
    radiates out from your palm. The shockwave always damages
    a target within range that you can see.

    Nonmagical, unattended objects (including doors, walls, locks,
    and so on) may also be damaged by this power.

  Short Description: Skate along ground and move faster
  Long Description: |
    You, another willing creature, or an unattended
    object can slide along solid ground as if on smooth ice. If
    you manifest skate on yourself or another creature, the target
    of the power retains equilibrium by mental desire alone, allowing
    them to gracefully skate along the ground, turn, or stop suddenly
    as desired. The skater's base movement speed increases by
    15 feet.

    The target can skate up or down any incline or decline they
    could normally walk upon without mishap, though skating up
    an incline reduces the target's speed to normal, while skating
    down a decline increases their speed by an additional 15 feet.

    If you manifest skate on an object, treat the object as having
    only one-tenth of its normal weight for the purpose of dragging
    it along the ground.

  Manifesting Time: 1 action
  Range: Self
  Duration: Permanent unless ended or dismissed, see text
  Requirements: None
  Short Description: Slow metabolism and appear dead
  Long Description: |
    Your mastery over your body allows you to
    slow your metabolism to a point that you are almost in suspended
    animation. Even powers that detect life or thought are incapable
    of determining that you are alive.

    While you are suspended, you are aware of your surroundings.
    You feel the passage of one day for every year that actually
    passes. Though on a slower schedule, you grow hungry after
    a `day' without food (though a year passes in actuality)
    and begin to suffer the effects of thirst and starvation as
    appropriate.

    If you take any damage, you come out of your trance 4 rounds
    later. The trance can also be ended by a successful use of
    dispel psionics. If you choose to dismiss the power, your
    trance ends 1 minute later.

  Manifesting Time: 1 action
  Range: Touch
  Duration: 1 round per psionic threshold
  Requirements: None
  Short Description: Move target briefly forward in time
  Long Description: |
    A creature of Medium size or smaller you
    touch when manifesting this power makes a Wisdom saving throw.
    If they fail, they move forward in time for a number of rounds
    equal to your psionic threshold. In effect, the target seems
    to disappear in a shimmer of silver energy, then reappear
    after the duration of this power expires. The target reappears
    in exactly the same orientation and condition as before. From
    the target's point of view, no time has passed at all.

    In each round of the power's duration, on what would have
    been the target's turn, it can attempt a Wisdom saving throw.
    Success allows the target to return and the power ends. When
    the target reappears---whether by succeeding on the save or
    the power's duration expiring---the target can act normally
    on their next turn.

    If the space from which the target departed is occupied upon
    their return to the time stream, they appear in the closest
    unoccupied space, still in their original orientation. Determine
    the closest space randomly if necessary.
  Augment: |
    You can augment this power in one or
    both of the following ways.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item For every 2 additional psi dice you spend,
        you can affect a creature of one size category larger.
      \item For every 2 additional psi dice you spend,
        this power can affect an additional target.
        Any additional target cannot be more than
        15 feet from another target of the power.

  Manifesting Time: 1 action
  Range: Self
  Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
  Requirements: None
  Short Description: Perceive surroundings by touch
  Long Description: |
    You generate a subtle telekinetic field of
    mental contact, allowing you to `feel' your surroundings
    even in total darkness or when your sight would otherwise
    be obscured by your physical environment. Your touchsight
    field emanates from you out to 60 feet. You ignore invisibility,
    darkness, and concealment, though you must have line of sight
    to a creature or an object to discern it.

    You do not need to make Wisdom (Perception) checks to notice
    creatures; you can detect and pinpoint all creatures within
    60 feet. In many circumstances, comparing your regular senses
    to what you learn with touchsight is enough to tell you the
    difference between visible, invisible, hiding, and concealed
    creatures.

    of your touchsight field increases by 10 feet.

    you choose within 15 feet of you can add an extra 2d6 to saving
    throws against all Voice powers and powers that affect one's

    teleportation made by others within a 60-foot radius from
    you and that occurred the last minute.

    You know the direction and distance the individuals travelled
    as if you had casually seen the location. This power does
    not grant you any information on the conditions at the other
    end of the trace beyond the mental coordinates of the location.

    Your Voice bursts forth from you as tidal
    wave of raw force, knocking creatures down. Any creature that
    lies within a 30-foot cone centred on yourself must make a
    Dexterity or Strength saving throw (their choice), taking
    8d4 force damage on a failed saving throw or half as much
    on a successful roll. In addition, each target that failed
    the save is pushed 10 feet back and knocked prone.

    You reverse the direction of gravity in your

    or even traverse ceilings (you need not make any ability checks
    to traverse these surfaces). Because of the need to keep at
    least one foot in contact with the wall or ceiling at all

    weapon you are holding. The weapon deals an extra 4d8 points
    of cold, lightning, fire or thunder damage (as chosen by you
    at the time of manifestation) on a successful hit
    while the power remains active.

    This power can be manifested on a weapon that is magic or
    otherwise already deals damage the aforementioned types of
    damage, and if the weapon already deals the same type of damage

  Long Description: |
    You restore a severed extremity to a creature
    that has lost a digit, hand, arm, leg, or even its head. This
    power does not restore life, but it returns a lost extremity
    to a living or dead creature if the creature is otherwise
    mostly intact. The original extremity need not be present
    when this power is manifested; a new extremity is created
    by the power. If a head is restored to a body, the original
    head (if not already destroyed) loses all spark of identity,
    and can be considered as dead tissue.

  Requirements: None
  Short Description: Fuse yourself and another creature into one
    entity temporarily
  Long Description: |
    You and another willing, corporeal, living
    creature of the same or smaller size fuse into one being.
    As the manifester, you control the actions of the fused being.
    However, you can give up this control to the other creature.
    Once you give up control, you cannot regain it unless the
    other creature relinquishes it.

    The fused being has your current hit points plus the other
    creature's current hit points. The fused being knows all
    the powers you and the other creature know, has the sum of
    your and the other creature's psi dice, has the sum of your
    and the other creature's spell slots, and knows or has prepared
    any spells you or the other creature possesses (if any). Likewise,
    all feats, racial abilities, and class features are pooled
    (if both creatures have the same ability, the fused being
    gains it only once). For each of the six ability scores, the
    fused being's score is the higher of yours and the other
    creature's, and the fused being also has the higher hit dice
    and psionic threshold; this effectively means the fused being
    uses the better saving throws, attack bonus, and skill modifiers
    of either member, and it manifests powers up to the higher
    of the psionic thresholds that you or the other creature possessed
    before becoming fused.

    You decide what equipment is absorbed into the fused being
    and what equipment remains available for use. These fused
    items are restored once the power ends.

    When the power ends, the fused being separates. The other
    creature appears in an area adjacent to you that you determine.
    If separation occurs in a cramped space, the other creature
    is expelled through the Astral Plane, finally coming to rest
    materially in the nearest empty space and taking 1d6 force
    damage for each 10 feet of solid material passed through.

    Damage taken by the fused being is split evenly between you
    and the other creature when the power ends. You do not leave
    the fusion with more hit points than you entered it with,
    unless you were damaged prior to the fusion and the fused
    being was subsequently healed. In a like manner, the fused
    being's remaining psi dice are split between you and
    the other creature (you can leave with more psi dice than you
    entered with, as long as you don't exceed the maximum psi dice
    for your level and ability score).

    If a fused being is killed, it separates into its constituent
    creatures, both of which are also dead.

    direction. The speed of the wind in empty spaces you can see
    within 120 feet of you can
    be increased or decreased by up to 10 knots. This power also
    gives you the ability to alter the direction of the wind by
    as much as 90 degrees.

    Powerful enough winds can cause creatures to be knocked prone.
    Creatures of size Small or smaller that are subject to winds
    between 25--45 knots must succeed on a DC 10 Strength saving
    throw or be knocked prone. If they wind speed is greater than
    45 knots, this applies to Medium creatures as well (DC 10),
    and the DC for size Small or smaller increases by 5.
  Augment: |
    For every additional psi die you spend, you
    can modify the wind speed by an additional 10 knots,
    to a maximum change in wind speed of 50 knots.
Energy Missile:
  Name: Energy Missile
  Class: p-PK
  Level: '2'
  Discipline: Psychokinesis
  MB: '2'
  PD: '3'
  Manifesting Time: 1 action
  Range: 120 feet
  Duration: Instantaneous
  Requirements: Sight, Line of Effect
  Short Description: Hurl missiles of energy at up to 5 distinct
    targets
  Long Description: |
    Upon manifesting this power, you choose cold,
    lightning, fire, or thunder. You release a powerful missile
    of energy of the chosen type at up to five creatures you can
    see in range and have line of effect to. Make a psionics attack
    against each target. On a hit, the missile deals 3d6 points
    of damage of the chosen type. You cannot hit the same target
    multiple times with the same manifestation of this power.

    ***Cold.*** A missile of this energy type deals +1
    point of damage per die. The saving throw to reduce damage
    from a cold missile is a Constitution save instead of a Dexterity
    save.

    ***Lightning.*** Manifesting a missile of this energy
    type provides a +2 bonus to the attack roll against creatures
    wearing metal armour.

    ***Fire.*** A missile of this energy type deals +1
    point of damage per die.

    ***Thunder.*** A missile of this energy type deals
    -1 point of damage per die but reduces an opponent's AC by
    1 for this attack only.
  Augment: |
    For every additional psi die you spend, this power's
    damage increases by 1d6.
Control Body:
  Name: Control Body

  Discipline: Psychokinesis
  MB: '4'
  PD: '7'
  Manifesting Time: 1 action
  Range: 60 feet
  Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
  Requirements: Sight
  Short Description: Take rudimentary control of a creature
  Long Description: |
    You psychokinetically control the actions
    of any humanoid (including undead or outsiders with a humanoid
    physiology) that you can see within range. The target immediately
    makes a Strength saving throw, with the power ending if they
    succeed and continuing if they fail. Control body doesn't
    require mental contact with the target, since you are actually
    forcing limb movements independent of the target's mind.
    You can force the target to stand up, sit down, walk, turn
    around, and so on, but operating the vocal cords is too difficult.
    You can also hold the target immobile, rendering it paralysed.
    You cannot force the target to manifest powers, cast spells,
    or use any special ability that is not a function of just
    its body movements. If you lose sight of the target, the effect
    of this power ends.

    If you force the target to engage in combat, its attack bonus
    is equal to your psionics attack bonus, and its bonus on damage
    rolls is equal to your psionics ability modifier.
    A creature subject to this power cannot take reactions.
    The target gains no benefit to its AC from its Dexterity,
    but it does gain a bonus to
    its AC equal to your Intelligence bonus.

    Although the subject's body is under your control, the subject's
    mind is not. Creatures capable of taking purely mental actions
    (such as manifesting powers) can do so.
  Augment: |
    For every 2 additional psi dice you spend, this power
    can affect a target one size category larger.

  Manifesting Time: 1 action
  Range: 120 feet
  Duration: Instantaneous
  Requirements: Sight
  Short Description: 'Create an immense vortex of air dealing
    great damage and knocking enemies about'
  Long Description: |
    You induce the formation of a slender vortex
    of fiercely swirling air. When you manifest it, a vortex of
    air visibly and audibly snakes out from your outstretched
    hand, originating at a point you can see in range.
    Alternatively,
    if you want to aim the vortex at a specific creature you can
    see in range, you can make a psionics attack to strike the
    creature. If you succeed, direct contact with the vortex deals
    8d6 bludgeoning damage to the creature.

    Regardless of your choice,
    all creatures (including the one possibly damaged
    by direct contact) within a cylinder of radius
    40 feet and height 100 feet are picked up and violently dashed
    about, dealing 17d6 bludgeoning damage to each one. Creatures
    that make a successful Dexterity save take half damage.

    After being dashed about, each creature that was affected
    finds itself situated in a new space 1d4 times 10 feet away
    from its original space in a random direction. Walls and other
    barriers can restrict this relocation; in such a case, the
    creature ends up adjacent to the barrier.

  Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
  Requirements: Sight
  Short Description: 'Return a creature to their native plane
    of existence or a demiplane'
  Long Description: |
    You warp space and time,
    attempting to force a creature to return back to their
    native plane of existence.
    The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw,
    otherwise they succumb to the effects described below.

    If the target is native to the plane of existence you are on,
    they are transported to a pocket dimension just large enough
    to encompass their physical size.
    The pocket dimension is harmless,
    and the target is free to take actions as normal.
    The target remains there until the power ends,
    in which case they return to the space they previously occupied
    before being banished or, if that space is occupied,
    the nearest unoccupied space.

    If the target is not native to the plane of existence you are on,
    the target is shunted through space and returned to its home plane.
    The target has a limited degree of control on its homewards journey,
    and, if they succeed on another Charisma saving throw,
    may choose the rough location of their arrival.
    If the power ends before 1 minute has passed,
    the target returns in the same way as described in the foregoing paragraph.
    Otherwise,
    the target does not return.
  Augment: |
    For every 3 additional psi dice you spend, you can
    target one additional creature.

  Duration: 1 round per psionic threshold
  Requirements: None
  Short Description: 'Inflict psychic damage and the poisoned
    condition with your touch'
  Long Description: |
    Your mere touch grants a creature a vision
    of the limitless potential of the not-yet-determined future,
    possibilities undulating like a cloth blowing in the wind.
    Unaccustomed to such a revelation, the creature's mind is
    overwhelmed. Make a melee psionics attack against a creature.
    If the attack hits, the creature takes 1d10 psychic damage
    and becomes poisoned for a number of rounds equal to your
    psionic threshold (concluding at the end of their turn
    in the final round).
  Augment: |
    For every two additional psi dice you spend, this
    power's damage increases by 1d8.
Distant Gaze:

  Manifesting Time: 1 action

  Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
  Requirements: None
  Short Description: 'See distant locations known or proximate
    to you'
  Long Description: |
    You can see and hear a distant location almost
    as if you were there. You don't need to see the location,
    but the locale must be known; that is, it must be a place
    familiar to you or an obvious one proximate to you, such as
    behind a nearby door, around a nearby corner, or in a grove
    of nearby trees.
    The location cannot be more than one mile from you.
    Once you have selected the locale, the focus
    of your clairvoyant sense doesn't move, but you can rotate
    it in all directions to view the area as desired. Unlike other
    scrying powers, this power does not allow psionically
    or supernaturally enhanced senses to work through it.

    If the chosen locale is magically or psionically dark, you
    see nothing. If it is naturally pitch black, you can see in
    a 10-foot radius around the center of the power's effect.
    The power does not work across planes.

  Manifesting Time: 1 minute
  Range: Touch
  Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
  Requirements: None
  Short Description: 'Learn details about an object''s former owners'
  Long Description: |
    You can learn details of an inanimate object's
    previous owner.
    Objects accumulate psychic impressions
    left by their previous owners,
    which can be read by use of this power.
    The amount of information revealed depends
    on how long you study a particular object.

    ***1st Minute.***
      Last owner's race.
    
    ***2nd Minute.***
      Last owner's gender.
    
    ***3rd Minute.***
      Last owner's age.
    
    ***4th Minute.***
      Last owner's alignment.
    
    ***5th Minute.***
      How last owner gained and lost the object.
    
    ***6th+ Minute.***
      Next-to-last owner's race, and so on.

    The power always correctly identifies the last owner of the item,
    and the original owner
    (if you keep the power active long enough).
    There is a 90\% chance
    that this power will successfully identify all other former owners
    in sequence,
    but there is a 10\% chance that one former owner
    will be skipped and thus not identified.

    This power will not identify casual users as owners
    (anyone who uses an object to attack someone
    or something is not thereafter considered a casual user).
    An object without any previous owners reveals no information.

    You can continue to run through a list of previous owners
    and learn details about them as long as the power's duration lasts.
    If you use this power additional times on the same object,
    the information yielded is the same
    as if you were using the power on the object for the first time.
  Augment: |
    For every additional psi die you spend, this power's
    maximum duration increases by 10 minutes.

  Manifesting Time: 1 hour
  Range: 60 feet
  Duration: Concentration, up to 1 hour
  Requirements: None
  Short Description: 'Glean information from the psychic impressions
    left in a locale'
  Long Description: |
    You gain historical vision in a given location.
    Rooms, streets, tunnels, and other discrete locations accumulate
    psychic impressions left by powerful emotions experienced
    in a given area. These impressions offer you a picture of
    the location's past.

    The types of events most likely to leave psychic impressions
    are those that elicited strong emotions: battles and betrayals,
    marriages and murders, births and great pain, or any other
    event where one emotion dominates. Everyday occurrences leave
    no residue for a manifester to detect.

    The vision of the event is dreamlike and shadowy. You do not
    gain special knowledge of those involved in the vision, though
    you might be able to read large banners or other writing if
    they are in your language.

    Beginning with the most recent significant event at a location
    and working backward in time, you can sense one distinct event
    for every 10 minutes you maintain concentration, if any such
    events exist to be sensed. Your sensitivity extends into the
    past a maximum number of years equal to 200 times your psionic
    threshold.

  Long Description: |
    As the \spell{scrying} spell, except as noted
    here. The power works across the planes of existence. In addition,
    instead of creating an invisible sensor which appears as a
    luminous orb, an ethereal form of yourself appears at the
    target's location, scarcely detectable to the naked eye.
    You, however, must succeed immediately on a Intelligence (Stealth)
    check to avoid detection contested by the target's passive
    Wisdom (Perception). You have a +10 bonus to this check.

    If you wish, you may speak through your ethereal form, however
    your voice is whispery and faint.

    You take a hand in influencing the probable
    outcomes of your immediate environment. You see the many alternative
    branches that reality could take in the next few seconds,
    and with this foreknowledge you gain the ability to, while
    this power lasts, reroll one attack roll, one saving throw,
    one ability check, or one skill check each round. You must
    take the result of the reroll, even if it's worse than the
    original roll. You do not have to make another roll if satisfied
    with your original roll. The roll must be made by yourself.

  Requirements: None
  Short Description: 'Learn uncannily accurate details of a creature
    you have seen before'
  Long Description: |
    You elevate your mind to a
    near-universal consciousness,
    cogitating countless impressions and predictions
    involving any creature you have seen before,
    whether personally or by means of another power
    such as \nameref{pwr:scrying_psionic}.

    This process gives you an uncannily accurate vision
    of the creature's nature,
    activities,
    and whereabouts.
    When you manifest the power,
    you learn the following facts about the creature.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Its name, race, alignment, and character class.
      \item A general estimate of its level and hit points.
      \item Its location (including place of residence, town,
            state, world, and plane of existence).
      \item Significant items currently in its possession.
      \item Any significant activities or actions the creature
            has undertaken in the previous 8 hours,
            including details such as locales travelled through,
            the names or races of those the creature fought,
            spells it cast,
            items it acquired,
            and items it left behind
            (including the location of those items).
      \item An instantaneous mental view of the creature's
            immediate state.
    \end{itemize}

    Sublime Insight can defeat spells,
    powers,
    and special abilities such as \spell{mind blank}
    (or even a \spell{wish} spell)
    that normally obscures Prescience powers.
    You can attempt a Intelligence check against
    a DC of 6 + the caster level of the
    creator of the obscuring effect)
    to defeat these sorts of otherwise impervious defences.

    This power is not guaranteed to work against gods, divine beings
    and other supremely powerful creatures.

  Long Description: |
    *Note: you cannot manifest this power
    unless you have learnt the \secref{subs:menu_a} Metacreativity tenet.*

    You weave mundane matter into an autonomous construct---vaguely
    resembling a humanoid creature of your choosing---that acts as you command.
    This power creates one 1st-level psionic golem
    (see \secref{sec:psionic_golem})
    that attacks your enemies. It appears where you designate
    in range and acts whenever you end your turn (it still technically
    acts on your turn, however). It attacks your opponents to
    the best of its ability. As a free action, on your turn you can mentally
    direct it not to attack, to attack particular enemies, or
    to perform other actions. The psionic golem acts normally
    on the last round of the power's duration and dissipates
    after you finish your turn. Otherwise, it dissipates when
    it is reduced to 0 hit points, ending the power.
  Augment: |

  Short Description: 'Plant an object of aversion in the mind
    of a creature'
  Long Description: |
    Your Voice plants a powerful aversion in
    the mind of a creature you can see in range
    and that can hear and understand you. If the object
    of the implanted aversion is an individual or a physical object,
    the target will prefer not to approach within 30 feet of it.
    If it is a word, they will try not to utter it; if it is an
    action, they will not willingly attempt to perform it; and
    if it is an event, they will not willingly attend it. The
    subject will take reasonable steps to avoid the object of
    its aversion, but will not put themselves in jeopardy by doing
    so.

    If the subject is forced into taking an action they have an
    aversion to, they have disadvantage on any attack rolls, ability
    checks, or skill checks involved.

  Manifesting Time: 1 action
  Range: 120 feet
  Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
  Requirements: Speech, Sight
  Short Description: 'Disrupt a creature''s breathing'
  Long Description: |
    Your Voice compels a humanoid creature you
    can see in range
    and that can hear and understand you
    to purge its entire store of air in one explosive
    exhalation, thereby disrupting its autonomic breathing
    cycle. The target's lungs do not automatically function again
    while the powers's duration lasts.

    If the target succeeds on a Wisdom save when crisis of breath
    is manifested, it is unaffected by this power. If it fails
    its Wisdom save, it can still continue to breathe by taking
    a standard action in each round to gasp for breath.

    An affected creature can attempt to take actions normally
    (instead of consciously controlling its breathing), but each
    round it does so, beginning in the round when it failed its
    Wisdom save, the target risks blacking out from lack of oxygen.
    It must succeed on a Constitution save at the end of any of
    its turns in which it did not consciously take a breath. The
    DC of this save increases by 1 in every consecutive round
    after the first one that goes by without a breath; the DC
    drops back to its original value if the target spends an action
    to take a breath.

    If a target fails its Constitution save, it becomes unconscious.
    At the end of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points but
    must take death saving throws. Curing powers or spells can
    revive a dying subject normally, so long as this power's
    duration has expired.
    If the power is still in effect, a revived
    creature still must take Constitution saves in each round
    when it does not consciously breathe.
  Augment: |
    You can augment this power in one or more of the following ways.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item If you spend 6 additional psi dice,

            all within a 20-foot radius.
      \item If you spend 4 additional psi dice,
            this power can also affect creatures other than a humanoid,
            assuming they have a aerobic respiratory system to disrupt.

  Short Description: 'Read creature''s surface level thoughts
    or probe deeper into their psyche'
  Long Description: |
    Your inner Voice peers into the minds of others,
    gleaning information otherwise concealed to you.
    When you manifest this power,
    and as an action on each turn until the power end,
    you can focus on any one creature you can see within 30 feet of you.
    If the creature has an Intelligence of 3 or lower,
    they are unaffected.

    While focusing on a creature,
    if the creature has an Intelligence of 14 or higher,
    the sensation of a presence within their mind grows on them.
    Nonetheless,
    you learn the surface level thoughts of that creature.
    `Surface level thoughts' includes what is most
    immediately on the creature's mind,
    however does not include information a creature is attempting to conceal
    unless they are careless or recklessly indifferent
    towards revealing that information.

    As an action,
    you can probe deeper into the creature's mind,
    in which case the creature must make a Wisdom saving throw.
    If they fail,
    you gain insight into one of its more inner desires,
    including something that looms large in its mind.
    You may then use another action to glean another piece of information
    from the creature, prompting a further save.
    If they succeed the original save, the power ends.
    Regardless,
    the creature knows that you are probing into its mind
    and can use an action on its turn to make an Intelligence check
    contested by a check using your psionics ability modifier.
    If the creature succeeds on the contest,
    the power ends.

    You can also use this power to detect the presence of thinking creatures
    you can't see.
    When you manifest the power or as your action during the duration,
    you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you.
    The power can penetrate barriers,
    but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead,
    or a thin sheet of lead blocks you.
    You can't detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower.
    Once you detect the presence of a creature in this way,
    you can read its thoughts for the rest of the duration as described above,
    even if you can't see it, but it must still be within range.

  Manifesting Time: 1 action
  Range: 60 feet
  Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
  Requirements: Speech, Sight
  Short Description: 'Compel a creature to pursue a course of
    action'
  Long Description: |
    Your Voice compels a creature to act according
    to your wishes. Choose a creature within range that you can see
    and that can hear and understand you.
    You then suggest a course of activity
    limited to no more than five words that that creature is to
    take. The course of action can be harmful to the creature
    or contrary to its intentions.

    The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. The target has
    advantage on the saving throw if the course of action is plainly
    harmful or against the creature's wishes. If the target fails,
    it pursues the course of action to the best of its ability.
    The compelled course of action can continue for the entire
    duration of the power. If the compelled activity can be completed
    in a shorter time, the power ends when the target finishes
    what it was asked to do.

    You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special
    activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest
    that a knight give her warhorse to the first beggar she meets.
    If the condition isn't met before the power expires, the
    activity isn't performed.

  Short Description: 'Teleport to a destination on the same plane
    of existence as you'
  Long Description: |
    This power allows you to transport yourself to another location
    on the same plane of existence as you.
    You must transport yourself,
    but may also choose up to four other willing creatures (or one object)
    that you can see within range.
    If you target an object, it must be able to fit entirely inside
    a 10-foot cube, and it can't be held or carried by an unwilling creature.
    
    The destination you choose to teleport to must be familiar to you.
    The degree of your familiarity with the location impacts
    the likelihood that you end up in that location.
    The DM rolls a d100 and consults the table below to resolve this.
    
    | Familiarity       | Mishap  | Similar Area | Off Target | On Target |
    | ---               | ---     | ---          | ---        | ---       |
    | Very familiar     | 01--05  | 06--13       | 14--24     | 25--100   |
    | Seen casually     | 01--33  | 34--43       | 44--53     | 54--100   |
    | Viewed once       | 01--43  | 44--53       | 54--73     | 74--100   |
    | Description       | 01--43  | 44--53       | 54--73     | 74--100   |
    | False destination | 01--50  | 51--100      | ---        | ---       |     
    
    ***Familiarity.***
      `Very familiar' is a place you have been very often,
      a place you have carefully studied,
      or a place you can see when you cast the spell.
      `Seen casually' is somewhere you have seen more than once
      but with which you aren't very familiar.
      `Viewed once' is a place you have seen once,
      possibly using magic or psionics.
      `Description' is a place whose location and appearance you know
      through someone else's description, perhaps from a map.
      `False destination' is a place that doesn't exist.
      Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy's sanctum
      but instead viewed an illusion,
      or you are attempting to teleport to a familiar location
      that no longer exists.

    ***On Target.***
      You and your group (or you and the target object)
      appear where you want to.
    
    ***Off Target.***
      You and your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away
      from the destination in a random direction.
      Your distance off target is 1d10$\times$1d10 percent of the distance
      that was to be travelled.
      For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles,
      landed off target,
      and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s,
      then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles.
      The DM determines the direction off target randomly
      by rolling a d8 and designating
      1 as north,
      2 as northeast,
      3 as east,
      and so on around the points of the compass.
      If you were teleporting to a coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea,
      you could be in trouble.
    
    ***Similar Area.***
      You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area
      that's visually or thematically similar to the target area.
      If you are heading for your home monastery,
      you might end up in the lodgings of another psionicist
      or a monk's residence that is visually similar to your monastery.
      Generally, you appear in the closest similar place,
      but since the power has no range limit,
      you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.

    ***Mishap.***
      The power's strain on your mind results in a difficult journey.
      Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 psychic damage,
      and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up
      (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time).

  Short Description: 'Create an illusory image in the mind of another'
  Long Description: |
    Your inner Voice convinces the mind of another that an illusory image
    is in fact real. Choose a creature you can see in range.
    The target must make an Intelligence saving throw.
    On a failed save, the mind of the target becomes aware of a phantasmic
    object or phenomenon---for example a change in temperature, pressure
    or the appearance of an object---only perceivable by them.
    You then stipulate the exact nature of the phantasm,
    which cannot be changed from this while you maintain concentration
    on the power. Moreover, the phantasm cannot be larger than a 10-foot cube
    or appear to affect a volume greater than the extent of the cube,
    whichever applies, and cannot be discontinuous.
    The phantasm can be moved freely either on your turn (requiring no action)
    or as stipulated by the initial conditions of the phantasm
    (for example if you specified the phantasm to be a wicker basket
    over the target's head which moves with them).
    The phantasm has no grounding in the physical world,
    only existing in the target's mind because of their fooled senses.

    A target affected by this power acts as if the phantasm were real
    unless their passive Intelligence (Investigation) is higher
    than your psionics save DC,
    in which case the illusion persists until the power ends
    but appears patently false
    (and therefore they do not suffer the effects described below).
    A target acting as if the phantasm is real rationalises any illogical
    outcomes which arise from interacting with the phantasm,
    even if the outcome is absurd or plainly at odds with the natural order.
    For example, a target attempting to walk across a phantasmal bridge
    that spans a chasm falls once it steps onto the bridge.
    If the target survives the fall, it still believes that the bridge exists
    and comes up with some other explanation for its fall---it was pushed,
    it slipped, or a strong wind might have knocked it off.

    An affected target is so convinced of the phantasm's reality
    that it can even take damage from the illusion.
    A phantasm created to appear as a creature can attack the target.
    Similarly, a phantasm created to appear as fire, a pool of acid,
    or lava can burn the target. Each round on your turn,
    the phantasm can deal 1d6 psychic damage to the target
    if it is in the phantasm's area or within 5 feet of the phantasm,
    provided that the illusion is of a creature or hazard
    that could logically deal damage, such as by attacking.
    The target perceives the damage as a type appropriate to the illusion.

    However, if as a result of stimuli extrinsic to the phantasm itself,
    the target has reason to believe that the phantasm is illusory, 
    they may make an Intelligence (Investigation) check to examine the phantasm
    against your psionics save DC.
    If the check succeeds, the target realises that the phantasm is not real,
    and the power ends.
    For example, an ally to the target may notice the target's erratic or
    illogical behaviour, and suggest to them that they are being afflicted
    by an illusion. This counts as sufficient reason to doubt the phantasm.

  Short Description: 'Interrupt the manifesting of a power'
  Long Description: |
    You briefly peer into a future where another creature
    has manifested a power. Armed with this uncanny insight,
    you attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of
    manifesting that power, preventing that future from actualising.
    If the creature is manifesting a power
    of 3rd level or lower, its power fails and has no effect.
    If it is manifesting a power of 4th level or higher,
    make an ability check using your psionics ability.
    The DC equals 10 + the power's level, as usual taking into account
    whether or not the power you are reacting to has been augmented.
    On a success, the creature's power fails and has no effect.

  Manifesting Time: 1 action
  Range: Self
  Duration: 12 hours
  Requirements: Mundane matter
  Short Description: 'Creating a copy of yourself'
  Long Description: |
    You shape mundane matter in your own likeness, creating a
    near-perfect physical copy of yourself.
    You then impress a shard of your own awareness into the copy.
    The copy is a creature of your own type and inherits your mental statistics,
    however its Strength, Dexterity and Constitution are all set to 5.
    In addition, the creature's hit point maximum is half yours.
    It may manifest any powers you know, except it has half your
    mental bandwidth, psionics threshold and psi dice (all rounded up).
    It does not inherit any of your spellcasting ability.

    The copy is loyal to you and any creatures you designate at the
    moment of its creation. However, the creature's alignment is the
    diametric opposite of your own. For example, if your own alignment
    is lawful good, the copy's alignment is chaotic evil. A neutral in
    either of your alignment axes is preserved for the copy;
    for example, neutral good becomes neutral evil; true neutral is mapped
    to true neutral, etc.
    The copy will therefore carry out objectives you designate
    as long as those objectives are consistent with their alignment.

    The copy persists until the power's duration ends, the copy
    is reduced to 0 hit points, or you manifest \nameref{pwr:alter_ego} again,
    at which point it returns to the matter from which it was constituted.

  Requirements: Mundane matter
  Short Description: 'Alter your physical appearance'
  Long Description: |
    Aided with mundane matter, you alter your physical appearance
    at the molecular level, concealing your true physical identity.
    You can make changes to your physical form, including your facial
    appearance, however you cannot change your apparent sex nor
    present features which would be atypical for your race.

    Unlike the \spell{disguise self} spell and use of a Disguise Kit,
    the changes wrought by \nameref{pwr:self_alchemy} hold up to
    physical inspection. Use of \nameref{pwr:detect_psionics}
    and similar powers or abilities, as normal,
    reveals that you are under some Metacreative psionic effect---but no more.
    In addition, an observer who sees you, listens to you speak and passes
    a Wisdom (Insight) check with DC equal to 10 + your psionics attack
    modifier becomes only aware that something is unnatural about you.

    The alteration to your appearance persists until you willingly
    reverse it as a free action. It also may be dispelled when you are subject
    to lightning damage. When this happens, make a Constitution saving
    throw with DC equal to 8 or half the lightning damage taken
    (whichever is higher). If you fail, the physical alteration is reversed.

  Long Description: |
    By manifesting this power, you place a psionic signature on a creature
    or an unattended object that you can see in range.
    If you target a creature, the signature is placed on that creature
    if they fail a Wisdom saving throw.
    You can automatically detect the presence of the signature
    whenever it is within 1,000 feet of you,
    and in such cases you know the direction and approximate distance
    to the target object or creature.

    If the distance between you and the psychic beacon
    increases beyond 1,000 feet, you can determine the direction
    and approximate distance to the signature object or creature
    by using an action.
  Augment: |
    You can augment this power in one or both of the following ways.

        this power's save DC (if applicable) increases by 1.
      \item If you spend 4 additional power points,
        you can designate a willing creature to detect the beacon.
        You must touch the creature as you manifest the power.
        For the duration of the power,

    Your index finger turns black as obsidian.
    A creature touched by you is partially assimilated into your form
    and takes 20d6 points of damage on a failed Constitution saving throw,
    or half as much on a success.
    Any creature reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by this power is killed,
    entirely assimilated into your form,
    leaving behind only a trace of fine dust.
    An assimilated creature's equipment is unaffected.

    A creature that is partially assimilated into your form
    (that is, a creature that has at least 1 hit point
    following your use of this power)
    grants you a number of temporary hit points equal to
    half the damage you dealt for 1 hour.

    A creature that is completely assimilated grants you
    a number of temporary hit points equal to
    the damage you dealt and a

    If you are affected by a psionic power of 3rd level or lower while this power is active,
    creatures with an affinity to you are also affected as if they were the target
    or one of the targets.
    All psionic effects transferred in this manner cease

  Long Description: |
    Duplicate Power lets you replicate many types of psionic effects,
    allowing you to do any of the following:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Duplicate any psion power of 6th level or lower,
            provided the power is not on a discipline sublist unavailable to you.
      \item Duplicate any other power of 5th level or lower,
            provided the power is not on a discipline sublist unavailable to you.
      \item Duplicate any psion power of 5th level or lower,
            even if it's on a discpline sublist unavailable to you.
      \item Combine the effects of any two powers known to you
            as long as sum of the two powers' levels is less than or equal to 8.
    \end{itemize}
    A duplicated power allows saving throws as normal, and has the same
    duration, requirements, range, etc. as the original power.
    If the original power specifies concentration as a requirement,
    that also applies when replicated with Duplicate Power.
    If you have replicated the effects of two powers with different requirements,
    the more restrictive requirement applies.
    For example, when combining two powers with a 60 ft. and 30 ft. range,
    the 30 ft. range applies for the overall combined effect produced with Duplicate Power.
