  long_description: |
    While integrated with a soulbreaker,
    on a critical hit with a melee weapon attack with the soulbreaker,
    the target must make a Wisdom saving throw.
    The DC is equal to 8 + psionics attack modifier
    (or just 8 + your Wisdom or Intelligence if you have no levels
    in psionic classes).
    If the target fails,
    they are stunned until the end of their next turn.
