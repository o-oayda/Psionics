# Psionics v1.5.0

## System & Rules
- `Triads` now reward manifesting powers from three unique disciplines at once. A triadic effects lookup table has been added, which describes the special 'triadic effect' applied depending on the relevant power's discipline and duration. 
- Clearly specified that a plyer cannot concentrate on multiple instances of the same power simultaneously.
- Augmenting a power now raises a powerâ€™s mental bandwidth cost by 1 in addition to its psi dice cost.

## Powers
- `Kinaesthetic Disruption`, `Tunnel Vision`, and `Spacetime Redirection` add fresh 2nd-level control tools that flip movement, collapse enemy sightlines, and redirect hits.
- `Trap Clairvoyance` (2nd level) grants sustained bonuses to find traps and lets the manifester burn psi dice to blunt trap damage.
- `Latent Presence` seeds a clone of the manifester's psyche into an object.
- Made powers which previously referenced spells more unique.
    - `Levitate` now provides a hover speed keyed to the manifester's psionics ability and augmenting boosts that multiplier, while `Psi Door` creates a short-lived two-way bridge others can risk crossing.
    - `Mind Blank, Psionic` blocks psychic damage, charm, and Voice/Prescience targeting.
    - `Psi Vision` projects a 120-foot cone of light.
    - `Psi Hand` allows 10 lb. telekinetic manipulation.
- `Drain Power` now saps 1d12 psi dice per round
- Increased `Mind Thrust` augment cost to 2 PD.

## Classes & Subclasses
- `Forms of Combat` now end whenever you let go of your Soulweapon, voluntarily or not.
- `Inner Voice` only bypasses language barriers after the target replies to the player's telepathic contact.
- Psion and Psi Knight power lists pick up the new 2nd-level options and Psions gain access to `Latent Presence`.
