    {Instantaneous}
You unleash a torrent of meaningless, sibilant sounds targeted
to distract those caught in the blast.
Any creature caught in a 60-foot cone centred on yourself must
make an Intelligence saving throw if they are concentrating on
a spell or power. If the target fails the save,
they immediately lose concentration. In addition,
regardless of whether they failed the save or not, a creature
caught in the cone has disadvantage on
Constitution saving throws made to maintain concentration on
a spell or power until the end of their next turn.
