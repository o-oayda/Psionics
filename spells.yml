  Short Description: |
    Distract foes with a stream of words to disrupt their concentration
  Long Description: |
    You unleash a torrent of meaningless, sibilant sounds targeted
    to distract those caught in the blast.
    Any creature that can hear you and is
    caught in a 60-foot cone centred on yourself must
    make an Intelligence saving throw if they are concentrating on
    a spell or power. If the target fails the save,
    they immediately lose concentration. In addition,
    regardless of whether they failed the save or not, a creature
    caught in the cone has disadvantage on
    Constitution saving throws made to maintain concentration on
    a spell or power until the end of their next turn. 
  Upcast: null
