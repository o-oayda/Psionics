Logorrhea:
  Name: Logorrhea
  Class: Wizard, Sorcerer, Bard
  Level: '2'
  School: Enchantment
  Casting Time: 1 action
  Range: Self (60-foot cone)
  Duration: Instantaneous
  Components: 'V, S, M (a papyrus scroll and a vial of ink)'
  Short Description: |
    Distract foes with a stream of words to disrupt their concentration
  Long Description: |
    You unleash a torrent of meaningless, sibilant sounds targeted
    to distract those caught in the blast.
    Any creature that can hear you and is
    caught in a 60-foot cone centred on yourself must
    make an Intelligence saving throw if they are concentrating on
    a spell or power. If the target fails the save,
    they immediately lose concentration. In addition,
    regardless of whether they failed the save or not, a creature
    caught in the cone has disadvantage on
    Constitution saving throws made to maintain concentration on
    a spell or power until the end of their next turn.

Mental Link:
  Name: Mental Link
  Class: Wizard, Cleric
  Level: '3'
  School: Abjuration
  Casting Time: 1 action
  Range: Touch
  Duration: 1 hour
  Components: V, S, M (a silver chain worth 50 gp)
  Short Description: Protect an ally from psionic effects
  Long Description: |
    You link your mind with a willing creature, cushioning it from
    the malign effects of hostile psionics.
    While the target is within 60 feet of you, they have resistance
    to any damage incurred from a psionic power
    or psi-like ability, and may add a d4 to any saving throw
    they make to resist a psionic power or psi-like ability.
    However, whenever they take psychic damage---regardless
    of whether it is caused by a psionic effect
    or not---you take half that damage (after applying resistances),
    with the target taking the other half.

    The spell ends when either you or your target drops to 0 hit points.
    You can also dismiss the spell as a free action on your turn.
